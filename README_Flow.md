NVIDIA Flow - UE4 Branch
========================

Flow is an adaptive sparse voxel fluid simulation library for real-time applications.

Included in this branch is a Flow UE4 integration, along with two sample projects. The integration is mostly isolated to a plugin, 
with minimal code added to the engine. NvFlowPluginSamples provides basic samples to demonstrate different functionality. NvFlowSamplesVR 
is configured to use the forward renderer with MSAA, and includes more self shadowed fire and smoke samples.
