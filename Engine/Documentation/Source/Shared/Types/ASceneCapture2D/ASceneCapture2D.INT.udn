Description:Overview of the SceneCapture2D class

[EXCERPT:ASceneCapture2D]

Much like the SceneCaptureCube, a SceneCapture2D makes an image of the scene on every frame. The SceneCapture2D captures the scene from its view frustum. It then stores that view as an image which is used within a Material.
