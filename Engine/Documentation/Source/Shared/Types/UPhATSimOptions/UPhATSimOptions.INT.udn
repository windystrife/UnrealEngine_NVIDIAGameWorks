Crumbs:

[EXCERPT:PhysicsBlend]

This value controls the blend between an animation that is playing, and the Physics Asset Tool's physical simulation. Values greater than 0.0 will have some amount of physics applied to them, while a value of 1.0 means the skeletal mesh is completely controlled by the Physics Asset.

[EXCERPT:PokePauseTime]

 This is the time between poking ragdoll and starting to blend back.

[EXCERPT:PokeBlendTime]

This is the time taken to blend from physics to animation.

[EXCERPT:FloorGap]
 
 This is the gap between the floor & physics object.

[EXCERPT:GravScale]
 
 This is the scale factor for the gravity used in the simulation.

[EXCERPT:HandleLinearDamping]

 This is the linear damping of mouse spring forces.

[/EXCERPT:HandleLinearDamping]




[EXCERPT:HandleLinearStiffness]


While using Ctrl +  Right Click while Simulating in the Physics Asset Tool, this value defines how rigidly the Physics Body keeps its Position in relation to the mouse cursor. A low value will result in the Physics Body continuing to fall. A high value will lock the Physics Body to the cursor.

With a low Handle Linear Damping value and a low Handle Linear Stiffness, you will not be able to affect the position of the Physics Body.

[EXCERPT:HandleAngularDamping]



[/EXCERPT:HandleAngularDamping]




[EXCERPT:HandleAngularStiffness]

While using Ctrl +  Right Click while Simulating in the Physics Asset Tool, this value defines how rigidly the Physics Body keeps its rotation. A low value here will allow the Physics Body more freely rotate (slowed by Angular Damping). Higher values will lock the Physics Body's rotation while interacting with Ctrl + Right Click.

[EXCERPT:InterpolationSpeed]

While in Simulating in the Physics Asset Tool, this defines how quickly the Physics Body you are interacting with using Ctrl + Right Click will track towards the mouse. Lower values will gently move the Physics Body, while higher values will snap it around.
[/EXCERPT:InterpolationSpeed]




[EXCERPT:PokeStrength]

The strength in newtons applied during a "ctrl + left  click" poke during simulation. For most things, the default 100 newtons will not give much of a reaction. For humanoid characters 1500 newtons is a good slap. 15000 newtons is a solid hit with blunt weapon of some sort. Above that and the reaction is like getting hit with a vehicle.

[EXCERPT:bPromptOnBoneDelete]

This will enable or disable the warning every time a Physics Body is deleted.

[EXCERPT:bShowConstraintsAsPoints]

This will show the Physics Constraints in the Physics Asset Tool as points instead of the traditional 3 Axis Crosses.

[EXCERPT:bShowNamesInHierarchy]

While the Hierarchy View option is enabled, the Bones in the Hierarchy will be labeled with their names.

[/EXCERPT:bShowNamesInHierarchy]




[EXCERPT:ConstraintDrawSize]

The crosses that visualize where the constraints are located are set to be the same size no matter how far from the camera they are. This can lead to them being hidden if the camera is too close to the skeletal mesh, as the crosses appear to retract into the mesh. Or if the camera is too far, all the crosses will become an overlapping mess.

![](PhAT_RTT_ConstraintScale.png)

Increasing this value will scale the crosses up, while reducing it will scale them down.
