[EXCERPT:BoneName]

The name of the Bone this Physics Body is associated with. In Blueprint interactions, to gain access to a Physics Body of a Bone in a Physics Asset, you will need to provide a Bone Name.

[EXCERPT:bConsiderForBounds]

Each Physics Body in a Physics Asset can be used to calculate the bounds of the Skeletal Mesh, but there is a performance overhead for each Physics Body used in this calculation. In many setups, you may have a Physics Body that assists with proper hit detection (twist bones on the arms), or perhaps the animation of the Skeletal Mesh makes it so some Physics Bodies never leave the bounds created by the other Physics Bodies. In these cases, there is some minor performance gain to be had by disabling the ability for these ineffective Physics Bodies from adding to the bounds calculation.

[EXCERPT:PhysicsType]

Default - Follow Owner
Fixed - Do not Follow Owner, but instead fix in place.
Unfixed - Do not Follow Owner, but remain unfixed.

Within the Physics Asset Tool, Default and Unfixed (with a constraint) will appear identical.

[EXCERPT:PhysMaterial]

Overrides the PhysMaterial for this specific Physics Body for use in Simple Collision (collision involving convex hulls or default Physics shapes such as spheres, boxes, and sphyls). This can give a specific Physics Body different properties, such as giving a Physics Body that defines a shoe more rubbery properties. Or if a Physics Body encompasses metal body armor, then it can have the same properties.

[EXCERPT:WalkableSlopeOverride]

Overrides the Walkable Slope settings for this physics body. Allows the angle at which the slope is determined to be walkable to be customised.

[EXCERPT:CollisionReponse]

Defines if a Physics Body will actually collide with anything. In a Physics Asset, any Physics Body can be set to collide with any other Physics Body in the asset. However, this does not have any effect in the level, those Physics Bodies will still collide with the world. However, setting this to Disabled will turn off all collisions for the selected Physics Body, regardless of that collision resulting from a world collision or a collision with another Physics Body contained within the Physics Asset.

The back wheel on this vehicle has its Collision Response disabled.

[EXCERPT:CollisionTraceFlag]

By default, when we add collision to physics world, we add two shapes of collision geometry. We add simple shapes to query simple collision - such as player walking physics - and we add complex shapes to query complex collision - such as hitting bullet when precision is important. 

Each trace function has a "TraceComplex" flag that will enable whether you'd like to trace complex or simple.

You can see the difference of two collisions in the above picture. 

You can create simple collision in editor.

However, if you'd like to use one shape for both of purpose, you can choose to do so. 

- Default - It adds two shapes to the world for two different queries. 
- Use Simple Collision As Complex - It adds simple collision as complex. It will add simple shape and it will be used for simple and complex query
- Use Complex Collision As Simple - It adds complex collision as simple. It will add complex shape and it will be used for simple and complex query
