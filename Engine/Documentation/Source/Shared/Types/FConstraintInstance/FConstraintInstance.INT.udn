[EXCERPT:JointName]

While working in the Physics Asset Tool, PhysicsConstraints are associated with a skinned Joint, and this field displays the name of that Joint.
[/EXCERPT:JointName]


[EXCERPT:ConstraintBone1]

In the Physics Asset Tool, this is the name of the first Physics Body the Physics Constraint is constraining. This is automatically populated during the generation or re-generation of a Physics Body.

In a Physics Constraint Actor or Component, this is the name of the Physics Body in a SkeletalMesh's Physics Asset you wish to constrain. You will need to manually populate this field with the Bone (Physics Body) name.

If you do not know the name of the Bone you are looking for, the easiest way to find a Bone name is to open the SkeletalMesh's Physics Asset in the Physics Asset Tool and look through the Physics Body's Bone Names.

[EXCERPT:bDisableCollision]

This will disable collision between the two Physics Bodies this Physics Constraint affects.

This is most often used in the Physic Asset Tool when it is often desirable to get Physics Bodies  to match as close as possible to the SkeletalMesh but not collide with each other at the joints where a little overlap is desirable.
[/EXCERPT:bDisableCollision]

[EXCERPT:LinearXMotion]

Sets linear freedom of the Physics Constraint along the X axis. The three states for this are LCM_Locked, LCM_Limited, and LCM_Free:

* LCM_Locked - This will prevent the Physics Constraint from moving along this axis.
* LCM_Limited - This will limit the movement of the Physics Constraint along this axis to the value in Linear Limit Size.
* LCM_Free - The Physics Constraint will be free to move along this axis.

All motions (linear or angular) align to the orientation of the Physics Constraint.

[/EXCERPT:LinearXMotion]

[EXCERPT:LinearYMotion]

Sets linear freedom of the Physics Constraint along the Y axis. The three states for this are LCM_Locked, LCM_Limited, and LCM_Free:

* LCM_Locked - This will prevent the Physics Constraint from moving along this axis.
* LCM_Limited - This will limit the movement of the Physics Constraint along this axis to the value in Linear Limit Size.
* LCM_Free - The Physics Constraint will be free to move along this axis.

All motions (linear or angular) align to the orientation of the Physics Constraint.

[/EXCERPT:LinearYMotion]

[EXCERPT:LinearZMotion]

Sets linear freedom of the Physics Constraint along the Z axis. The three states for this are LCM_Locked, LCM_Limited, and LCM_Free:

* LCM_Locked - This will prevent the Physics Constraint from moving along this axis.
* LCM_Limited - This will limit the movement of the Physics Constraint along this axis to the value in Linear Limit Size.
* LCM_Free - The Physics Constraint will be free to move along this axis.

All motions (linear or angular) align to the orientation of the Physics Constraint.

[/EXCERPT:LinearZMotion]

[EXCERPT:LinearLimitSize]

This one value sets the total linear distance the constrained Physics Bodies may travel along all axes set to Limited.

Or, if Linear Limit Soft is set to true, how far the constrained Physics Bodies may travel before being affected by the Spring and Damping properties.

![](PhysConRTT_LinearDistance.png)

In this case, you can see that even if the axes of the Physics Constraint are rotated, the total distance traveled along the two limited axes is only 100 units.

[/EXCERPT:LinearLimitSize]

[EXCERPT:bLinearLimitSoft]

With this enabled, Linear Limit Stiffness and Linear Limit Damping, will be used to determine what happens when a linear limit is hit.

It is worth noting that with Stiffness and Damping set to 0, it will require substantial force to push the constrained Physics Body beyond the Linear Limit Size, and even doing so it will return quite quickly due to the lack of Damping.
[VAR:ToolTipFullLink]
Engine/Physics/Constraints/ConstraintsReference#sharedproperties
[/VAR]

[/EXCERPT:bLinearLimitSoft]

[EXCERPT:LinearLimitStiffness]

This defines how hard a limited axis will resist going beyond its Linear Limit Size. While it is not a measure of force or restitution (bounciness), low values will appear to resist very little while high values will appear to bounce.

When used with a high Linear Limit Damping, the "bounce" will be absorbed, and the limit may simply be exceeded with no force able to pull against the damping effect.

Engine/Physics/Constraints/ConstraintsReference#sharedproperties
[/VAR]

[/EXCERPT:LinearLimitStiffness]

[EXCERPT:LinearLimitDamping]

This defines how much velocity is removed from the motion of the constraint while it is outside the Soft Limit. High values can cause the Physics Constraint to stop outside of its limit because it lacks the force to pull it back in and the Physics Body will enter a sleep state.

[/VAR]

[/EXCERPT:LinearLimitDamping]

[EXCERPT:bLinearBreakable]

Whether or not a linear force can be applied to break the constraint. See Linear Break Threshold for more information.

[/EXCERPT:bLinearBreakable]

[EXCERPT:LinearBreakThreshold]

This type of break is like a shearing or tensile break. The constraint in question does not bend but simply exceeds its structural limits by being torn like paper, or a rubber band snapping after being stretched too far.

To calculate what value should be used to have a Physics Constraint resist the tensile force applied by gravity, take the mass of your Physics Body, multiply by gravity times 100. For example, a Physics Constraint holding up a mass of 242kg in standard gravity (9.8m/s^2) would need at least a value of 237160 to resist breaking assuming no starting velocity.

Note: An axis needs to be set to LCM_Limited or LCM_Locked to have anything to break away from, LCM_Free axes cannot break.

[/EXCERPT:LinearBreakThreshold]

[EXCERPT:bEnableProjection]

If a simulation is really energetic or has many layers, Physics Bodies can separate from each other. Projection is a feature that will pull the renderable portions of the Physics Bodies back in line if they exceed either the linear or angular tolerance values set below.

[EXCERPT:ProjectionLinearTolerance]

This is the amount a Physics Constraint is allowed to deviate linearly, in units, before Projection kicks in.

[/EXCERPT:ProjectionLinearTolerance]

[EXCERPT:ProjectionAngularTolerance]

This is the amount a Physics Constraint is allowed to deviate angularly, in degrees, before Projection kicks in.

[/EXCERPT:ProjectionAngularTolerance]

[EXCERPT:AngularSwing1Motion]

The Angular Swing1 Motion aligns with the Z axis of the Physics Constraint. The three states for this are ACM_Locked, ACM_Limited, and ACM_Free:

* ACM_Locked - This will prevent the Physics Constraint from rotating along this axis.
* ACM_Limited - This will limit the rotation of the Physics Constraint along this axis. Each Swing Motion and the Twist Motion can have an individual limits.
* ACM_Free - The Physics Constraint will be free to rotate along this axis.

All motions (linear or angular) align to the orientation of the Physics Constraint.

[/EXCERPT:AngularSwing1Motion]

[EXCERPT:AngularSwing2Motion]

The Angular Swing1 Motion aligns with the Y axis of the Physics Constraint. The three states for this are ACM_Locked, ACM_Limited, and ACM_Free:

* ACM_Locked - This will prevent the Physics Constraint from rotating along this axis.
* ACM_Limited - This will limit the rotation of the Physics Constraint along this axis. Each Swing Motion and the Twist Motion can have an individual limits.
* ACM_Free - The Physics Constraint will be free to rotate along this axis.

All motions (linear or angular) align to the orientation of the Physics Constraint.

[/EXCERPT:AngularSwing2Motion]

[EXCERPT:AngularTwistMotion]

[/EXCERPT:bSwingLimitSoft]

[EXCERPT:SwingLimitStiffness]

This value defines how hard the Soft Limit will attempt to block the Angular Swing Motions. High values will look very bouncy, as if the Physics Constraint has a high Resilience value, whereas low values will not have any effect.

[/EXCERPT:SwingLimitStiffness]

[EXCERPT:SwingLimitDamping]

Enables the Physics Constraint to break if too much angular force is applied to the Physics Constraint.

[/EXCERPT:bAngularBreakable]

[EXCERPT:AngularBreakThreshold]

The Angular force required to break the Physics Constraint. To keep a Physics Constraint from breaking, this value will need to be very high. 500 million or higher values are not unheard of.

Note: An axis needs to be set to ACM_Limited or ACM_Locked to have anything to break away from, ACM_Free axes cannot break.
