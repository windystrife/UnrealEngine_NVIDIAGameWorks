Viewport Introduction
[/VAR]

[EXCERPT:ViewportIntro]
The **Viewports** are your window into the worlds you create in Unreal. They can be navigated just as you would in a game, or can be used in a more schematic design sense as you would for an architectural blueprint. The Unreal Editor viewports contain a variety of tools and visualizers to help you see exactly the data you need.

[EXCERPT:Stage3.1]

[VAR:StageTitle]
3D Viewport
[/VAR]

By default, the Level Editor has single 3D viewport visible:

![](3Dviewport.png)

This type of viewport shows the world in 3D as if it is being viewed from the perspective of a camera, similar to what you would see in-game.

[EXCERPT:Stage3.2]

[VAR:StageTitle]
2D Viewports
[/VAR]

Click the button in the top right corner of the viewport to minimize it revealing the 2D viewports that display orthographic views of the world.

These can be either Side, Front, or Top. Each of these shows the world looking down one axis of the world - X, Y, or Z respectively.

Viewport Layouts
[/VAR]

Viewports can be arranged in different configurations called layouts. The current layout can be chosen from the Viewport Options menu:

Now that you know a little more about the viewports, let us take a look at how to navigate around in the scene!

There are a number of mouse button combinations you can use to navigate the viewport:

1. Hold the Left Mouse Button and drag to move forward and backward and turn left and right.

[EXCERPT:Stage7]

[VAR:StageTitle]
Quick Focus
[/VAR]

You can quickly center, or focus, the viewport on objects within the world (commonly referred to as Actors) to make editing them easier.

**To focus the viewport on an Actor:**

1. Click an Actor in the viewport.

1. Press the F key to center and zoom on that Actor in the viewport.

[EXCERPT:Stage11]

[VAR:StageTitle]
Bookmarks
[/VAR]

Bookmarks are a way to record the position and rotation of the viewport camera for later use. When working on larger levels, the use of bookmarks will make it easier to quickly move around the level to key areas.

[/EXCERPT:Stage11]



[EXCERPT:Stage12]

[VAR:StageTitle]
Bookmarks
[/VAR]

Bookmarks are a way to record the position and rotation of the viewport camera for later use. When working on larger levels, the use of bookmarks will make it easier to quickly move around the level to key areas.

You can set a bookmark by using the Ctrl or Command key with the number keys along the top of the keyboard (ex: Ctrl + 0 through Ctrl + 9).

[EXCERPT:Stage13]

[VAR:StageTitle]
Bookmarks
[/VAR]

Bookmarks are a way to record the position and rotation of the viewport camera for later use. When working on larger levels, the use of bookmarks will make it easier to quickly move around the level to key areas.

You can set a bookmark by using the Ctrl or Command key with the number keys along the top of the keyboard (ex: Ctrl + 0 through Ctrl + 9).

Once a hotkey is set, you can return to its location by pressing the corresponding key (0-9).
