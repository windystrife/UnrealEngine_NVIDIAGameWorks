Texture
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:Definition]

[EXCERPT:Glossary_Texture]
**Textures** are images that are used in Materials. They are mapped to the surfaces the Material is applied to. Either Textures are applied directly - for example, for Base Color textures - or the values of the Texture's pixels (or _texels_) are used within the Material as masks or for other calculations. In some instances, Textures may also be used directly, outside of materials, such as for drawing to the HUD. For the most part, Textures are created externally within an image-editing application, such as Photoshop, and then imported into Unreal Editor through the **Content Browser**. However, some Textures are generated within Unreal, such as Render Textures. These generally take some information from the scene and render it to a Texture to be used elsewhere.

Timeline node
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:Definition]

[EXCERPT:Glossary_Timeline_node]
**Timeline nodes** are special nodes within Blueprints that allow for simple time-based animation to be quickly designed and played back based on in-game events. Timelines are somewhat like simple Matinee sequences 
in that they allow simple values to be animated and events to be fired off over time. These can be edited 
directly inside the Blueprint editor by **Double-clicking** on the Timeline in the Graph tab or in the My Blueprint tab. They are specifically built for handling simple, non-cinematic tasks such as opening doors, altering 
lights, or performing other time-centric manipulations to Actors within a scene.
