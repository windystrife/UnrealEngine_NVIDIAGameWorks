[EXCERPT:Glossary_wire]
A **wire** is a line connecting two nodes in the graph section of a visual script, such as a Blueprint. You create wires by dragging from the pins on nodes. You can drag a wire from a pin on one node to a pin on another node, or you can drag from a pin to an empty space, and use the context menu that is created to select another node to add to your graph. Like pins, wires are color-coded.

World

	[PARAM:Definition]

[EXCERPT:Glossary_world]
A **World** contains a list of Levels that are loaded. It handles the streaming of Levels and the spawning (creation) of dynamic Actors. 

Direct interaction with a World is not necessary, but it does help provide a specific reference point within the game structure (ie: mentioning World directly means you are not speaking about Levels, Maps or the game).
