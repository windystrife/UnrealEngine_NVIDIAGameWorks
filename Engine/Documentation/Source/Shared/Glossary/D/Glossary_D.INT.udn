![Blueprint Data Pin Types](k2_pins_data_types.png)

**Data pins** are used for taking data into a node or outputting data from a node. Data pins are type-specific and can be wired to variables of the same type (which have data pins of their own) or a data pin of the same type on another node. Like execution pins, data pins are displayed as an outline when not wired to anything, and solid when wired.

![Blueprint Data Pins](k2_pins_data.png)

Nodes can have any number of input or output data pins. The data pins of a Function Call node correspond to the parameters and return value of the corresponding function.
