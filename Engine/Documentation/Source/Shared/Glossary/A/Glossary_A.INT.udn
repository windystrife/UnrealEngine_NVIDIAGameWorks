Actor
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:Definition]
<!--
**Actors** are the most important concept in Unreal Engine 4. Your game will be filled with them, as every interactive entity in your game is an Actor. They usually contain one or more components, can be placed in a **Level** or **Spawned** in during gameplay, and support network replication for multiplayer games.
-->

[EXCERPT:Glossary_Actor]
An **Actor** is any object that can be placed into a level. Actors are a generic Class that support 3D transformations such as translation, rotation, and scale. Actors can be created (spawned) and destroyed through gameplay code (C++ or Blueprints). In C++, AActor is the base class of all Actors. 

There are several different types of Actors, some examples include: StaticMeshActor, CameraActor, and PlayerStartActor.

AIController

	[PARAM:Definition]

[EXCERPT:Glossary_AIController]
Just as the PlayerController possesses a Pawn as a representation of the player in a game, an **AIController** possesses a Pawn to represent a non-player character (NPC) in a game. By default, Pawns and Characters will end up with a base AIController unless they are specifically possessed by a PlayerController or told not to create an AIController for themselves.

	[PARAM:Definition]

[EXCERPT:Glossary_animation]
**Animation** is a change in a property value over time. Examples include changes in position, rotation, and/or scale, but can also extend to any other property value as well.

"Animation" can refer specifically to sequences created in Unreal Matinee, or to sequences created for Skeletal Meshes in external 3D modeling and animation applications, and then imported into the Unreal Editor. It can even refer to a change over time in an Actor's property (or properties) created by C++ code or Blueprints.
