[EXCERPT:SkeletonMode]

The skeleton mode lets you view properties of a skeleton asset.
* Edit Animation Notifies that belong to this skeleton

### Overview

In Unreal Engine 4, Skeletons are assets that are separate from Skeletal Meshes. Each Skeletal Mesh requires a Skeleton to be associated with it, and all animation assets (such as Animation Sequences, Animation Montages, and Blend Spaces) are associated with the Skeleton, not with the Skeletal Mesh.

### What is a Skeleton?

If you are familiar with digital content creation, you may already feel like you know what a "skeleton" is. In most 3D applications, a skeleton is a digital hierarchical framework that is used to define bones or joints in a character and in many ways mimics a real biological skeleton. 

![](MayaSkeleton.png)

An important distinction is that a Skeleton asset is NOT the same thing as the bone hierarchy found within a Skeletal Mesh. In Unreal Engine 4, the Skeleton asset is less like a 3D representation of an actual skeleton and more like a list which holds bone and hierarchy information for a specific type of character or Skeletal Mesh. It is through this list that animation associations are made. 

In terms of its place in the animation system, it is probably best to think of a Skeleton asset as an intermediary between Skeletal Meshes and animations. Multiple Skeletal Meshes can use the same Skeleton asset, and any Skeletal Meshes using the same Skeleton asset will be able to share animations.

[EXCERPT:AnimBlueprintPropertyEditorPreviewMode]
Changing the properties listed in preview mode will only affect the instance shown inside this session of Persona. Instances outside of Persona such as in the level editor will not be affected and the properties will not be saved with the asset as defaults, use this mode to test the blueprint functionality without altering the asset.
[/EXCERPT:AnimBlueprintPropertyEditorPreviewMode]

[EXCERPT:AnimBlueprintPropertyEditorDefaultMode]
Changing the properties listed in defaults mode will save the values in the asset as defaults for every instance of this blueprint.

[EXCERPT:SkeletonTree_Window]

###Overview

This shows a list of bones for skeleton or for mesh. By default, it displays all the bones that belong to mesh and skeleton. 

* Bone Display
	* Bold/White	: Current preview mesh has the bone and the bone is weighted.
	* White			: Current preview mesh has the bone, but the bone is not weighted.
	* Gray			: Current preview mesh does not contain the bone, but skeleton has it.

###Socket

By default, socket is added to skeleton. That way you share the sockets for all the meshes that belong to this skeleton. 
If you would like to modify for current preview mesh, use "Customize" option.
If you would like to commit back to skeleton, use "Promote" option.

* Socket Display
	* Gray			: Sockets that belong to skeleton.
	* Red			: Sockets that is customized or belong to current preview mesh.

[EXCERPT:AssetBrowser_Window]

Asset Browser is a mini version of the **Content Browser** that displays all animation assets that belong to current viewing skeleton. 
You can type animation name or class type to find the assets. 

 * If you **double click** the asset in the asset browser, it will open the asset in the editor.  
 * If you **Hover** over the asset, it will show a floating preview, but it does not open in the animation editor.

[EXCERPT:AnimationNotifies_Window]

Animation Notifies tab lists all the custom animation notifies that are used. 

This does not display blueprint notifies (such as Play sound or Play particle effect), but it does display custom made notifies. 

![](CustomAnimNotify.PNG)

In this panel, you can remove, rename the custom animation notifies. If you remove or rename, please note that you will have to resave all animations that have this notify. 
Otherwise it will not be removed or renamed correctly.

[/EXCERPT:AnimationNotifies_Window]

[EXCERPT:RetargetManager]

Retarget Manager contains 3 sections to help retargeting within a skeleton or between skeletons. 

1. Manage Retarget Source 
Retarget Source Manager allows you to create multiple retarget sources of the animations for maintaining body proportion within one skeleton. 
If you have different body types of characters who shares the same animation using the skeleton, this is where you can add those sources of the animations. 

For example, if you have 3 body types for one skeleton, small, medium, big, and if your skeleton is made from medium, then all retargeting option will work correctly as far as the animation is made from the medium skeleton. 
But if you would like to make an animation for big skeleton, it will treat as medium skeleton when retarget. 
To fix the issue, you will have to set up proper retarget source for the animation. 
You can create retarget source of big skeleton, and set the retarget source of the animation to it, then it will retarget with correct proportion applied. 

You can create retarget source by clicking Add button. Or use context menu to delete or rename. 

2. Set up Rig

If you would like to retarget the related assets of this skeleton to another skeleton, you need to configure the rig. 

Please select the rig, you would like to use, and configure your setup. Select which bone map to which node from the rig. 
Once you set this up, you should be able to retarget to another skeleton with the same rig set up. 

3. Manage Retarget Base Pose

When you retarget, the meshes between two should have same base pose to retarget. By default, the Retarget Base Pose is the Reference pose. 
The recommended pose for retarget is T-pose. If you have A pose, please make sure you edit the pose to match T-pose here. 

Click View/Edit button, and then edit the pose using the bone transform widget, and Save to the pose. 

[/EXCERPT:RetargetManager]

[EXCERPT:RetargetSource]

Retarget Source Manager allows you to create multiple retarget sources of the animations for maintaining body proportion within one skeleton. 
If you have different body types of characters who shares the same animation using the skeleton, this is where you can add those sources of the animations. 

For example, if you have 3 body types for one skeleton, small, medium, big, and if your skeleton is made from medium, then all retargeting option will work correctly as far as the animation is made from the medium skeleton. 
But if you would like to make an animation for big skeleton, it will treat as medium skeleton when retarget.

[EXCERPT:RigSetup]

If you would like to retarget the related assets of this skeleton to another skeleton, you need to configure the rig. 

Please select the rig you would like to use, and configure your setup. Select which bone map to which node from the rig. 
Once you set this up, you should be able to retarget to another skeleton with the same rig set up. 

[/EXCERPT:RigSetup]

[EXCERPT:SetupBasePose]

When you retarget, the meshes between two should have same base pose to retarget. By default, the Retarget Base Pose is the Reference pose. 
The recommended pose for retarget is T-pose. If you have A pose, please make sure you edit the pose to match T-pose here. 

Click View/Edit button, and then edit the pose using the bone transform widget, and Save to the pose.

[EXCERPT:MorphTarget_Window]

In the Morph Target Preview window, you can preview all morph targets that belong to current preview mesh.

[EXCERPT:AnimationAssetDetail_Window]

This window displays the property of current asset that's being displayed. 

[/EXCERPT:AnimationAssetDetail_Window]

[EXCERPT:AnimationEdit_Window]

In this panel, you can edit each asset. You can add AnimSequence, BlendSpace, AnimMontage, or AnimComposite. 

[/EXCERPT:AnimationEdit_Window]

[EXCERPT:AnimationDetail_Window]

This window is used to display detail information of property if any notify is selected or any socket or bone is selected. 

[/EXCERPT:AnimationDetail_Window]

[EXCERPT:MeshDetail_Window]

In this window, you can edit mesh properties such as 

* You can modify material on the current preview mesh.
* You can modify LOD data.
* You can modify physics assets.

[/EXCERPT:MeshDetail_Window]

[EXCERPT:TranslationRetargeting]

Retargeting can be set up from the Skeleton Tree panel in Persona.

Typically, you will want to use these settings for bipeds:

* Root Bone, IK Bones, weapon bones, and any kind of markers will use the Animation mode.
* The pelvis will use AnimationScaled so it sits at the right height and is still animated. And any other bone you want translation to be animated and retargeted should also use AnimationScaled.
* All other bones will use Skeleton. They will use the static translation from the target skeleton.

This means that if you want to use retargeting, a fast workflow would be:

1. Right-click on your root bone and recursively set all bones to Skeleton.
2. Find the Pelvis or equivalent bone and set that to AnimationScaled.
3. Find the Root bone, any IK bones, any weapon bones, or other marker-style bones and set them to use Animation.

* In the Show menu from the viewport, you can check NonRetargeted Animation and Bones to compare the original with the retargeted animation.

[EXCERPT:AdditionalMeshes]

You can add additional body parts which share the same skeleton. Please be careful as these are just for previewing. To change body parts in game mode, you should use the master pose component by calling the SetMasterPoseComponent method in SkinnedMeshComponent.

[EXCERPT:AddClothing]

Select an APEX clothing asset file that corresponds to your skeletal mesh. 

### Overview
APEX data is loaded into a skeletal mesh and can be associated with a particular section / material. Once associated, the original section's triangles are hidden and the render data from the APEX file is used instead. 
You can reimport the FBX and the APEX data will remain. You can also reimport the APEX data at any time. Selecting "None" in the material's Clothing combo box or removing the APEX asset from the mesh will recover the original FBX vertex data for the section. With multiple submeshes in one APEX file, it is possible to have multiple sections simulated as a single piece of clothing (eg a jacket with a metal button material and leather material).

### After Adding an asset file?

![](ClothingCombo.png)
Notice Clothing combo boxes have appeared in the Materials section. Selecting a clothing asset (and submesh, if the asset contains multiple submeshes) will replace that section with the APEX clothing asset's vertex data and associate it with the simulation mesh.

[EXCERPT:AnimRemapSkeleton_ConvertSpace]

This option will convert animation data to new skeleton spaces. This only works if the original skeleton has the same bind pose with target skeleton. 

If original skeleton has T-pose ref pose, the target should also have T-pose to convert it correctly. If the original skeleton has A-pose ref pose, the target also should match A-pose. 

If you turn this off, the animation data will not be converted but copied directly to target skeleton. 

[/EXCERPT:AnimRemapSkeleton_ConvertSpace]

[EXCERPT:AnimRemapSkeleton_ShowCompatbielSkeletons]

This option will display only compatible skeletons. To make this useful, you need to configure rig option in Retarget Manager. 

Make sure you have same retarget base pose in both skeletons. If not please use Retarget Manager - Manage Retarget Base Poses to modify. 

We recommend setting up your character in a T-pose.
