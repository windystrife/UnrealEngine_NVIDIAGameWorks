This is a list of error or warning messages you may encounter during importing FBX files. 


## Generic 

(#Generic_ImportingNewObjectFailed)
[EXCERPT:Generic_ImportingNewObjectFailed]

Importing failed to create new asset. In this case, you are likely to have other warning messages that indicate the cause of the failures. 

[/EXCERPT:Generic_ImportingNewObjectFailed]

---

(#Generic_LoadingSceneFailed)
[EXCERPT:Generic_LoadingSceneFailed]

Loading FBX Scene has failed. Either the file is corrupted or it is not the correct file type. 

[/EXCERPT:Generic_LoadingSceneFailed]

---

(#Generic_SameNameAssetExists)
[EXCERPT:Generic_SameNameAssetExists]

An asset already exists with the given name. Make sure to use a different name to import or import into a different folder. 

[/EXCERPT:Generic_SameNameAssetExists]

---

(#Generic_SameNameAssetOverriding)
[EXCERPT:Generic_SameNameAssetOverriding]

Currently importing asset is going to replace currently existing asset of the same name.

[/EXCERPT:Generic_SameNameAssetOverriding]

---

(#Generic_CannotDeleteReferenced)
[EXCERPT:Generic_CannotDeleteReferenced]

When overriding existing assets, the importer needs to delete the old asset first, however the importer cannot delete it because of references.

Try using a different name or importing into a different folder. 

[/EXCERPT:Generic_CannotDeleteReferenced]

---

(#Generic_FBXFileParseFailed)
[EXCERPT:Generic_FBXFileParseFailed]

Opening file and importing has failed. Either the file is corrupted or it is not the correct file type. 

[/EXCERPT:Generic_FBXFileParseFailed]

---

(#Generic_MeshNotFound)
[EXCERPT:Generic_MeshNotFound]

No Mesh was found in the file. Make sure the FBX contains a mesh object. 

[/EXCERPT:Generic_MeshNotFound]

---

## Mesh

(#Generic_Mesh_NoGeometry)
[EXCERPT:Generic_Mesh_NoGeometry]

[/EXCERPT:Generic_Mesh_NoGeometry]

---

<!-- It doesn't contain any base layer.  -->

(#Generic_Mesh_TriangulationFailed)
[EXCERPT:Generic_Mesh_TriangulationFailed]

Mesh is composed of polygons other than triangles, so the importer attempted to triangulate, but failed. Check the source content and triangulate it in your DCC tool. 

[/EXCERPT:Generic_Mesh_TriangulationFailed]

---

(#Generic_Mesh_ConvertSmoothingGroupFailed)
[EXCERPT:Generic_Mesh_ConvertSmoothingGroupFailed]

The importer only supports smoothing on a polygon level, and when smoothing was done by edge, the importer will attempt to convert edge smoothing to polygon smoothing, but that has failed.

(FBX API ComputePolygonSmoothingFromEdgeSmoothing.)

[/EXCERPT:Generic_Mesh_ConvertSmoothingGroupFailed]

---

(#Generic_Mesh_UnsupportingSmoothingGroup)
[EXCERPT:Generic_Mesh_UnsupportingSmoothingGroup]

[/EXCERPT:Generic_Mesh_MeshNotFound]

---

(#Generic_Mesh_NoSmoothingGroup)
[EXCERPT:Generic_Mesh_NoSmoothingGroup]
No smoothing group information was found in this FBX scene.  Please make sure to enable the "Export Smoothing Groups" option in the FBX Exporter plug-in before exporting the file.

Even for tools that do not support smoothing groups, the FBX Exporter will generate appropriate smoothing data at export-time so that correct vertex normals can be inferred while importing.

[/EXCERPT:Generic_Mesh_NoSmoothingGroup]

---

(#Generic_Mesh_LOD_InvalidIndex)
[EXCERPT:Generic_Mesh_LOD_InvalidIndex]
Invalid Mesh LOD index. In order to add LOD(N), the current mesh should contain all of LOD from [0-(N-1)].

[/EXCERPT:SkeletalMesh_TooManyVertices]

---

(#SkeletalMesh_FailedToCreatePhyscisAsset)
[EXCERPT:SkeletalMesh_FailedToCreatePhyscisAsset]
If you have [Create Physics Asset] on, it will try to create physics asset. 

It can fail if:

1. The importer failed to create the Skeletal Mesh (and thusly has no bones to build the Physics Asset)

2. The mesh is too small and the Physics Asset creation default setting will not work with it. 

If this fails, you can create physics asset after imported.

Bring up the Right-Click Context menu on the Skeletal Mesh -> Create... -> Create Physics Asset. You can then adjust the settings for creating a Physics Asset to work with the size of your Skeletal Mesh.

[/EXCERPT:SkeletalMesh_FailedToCreatePhyscisAsset]

---

(#SkeletalMesh_SkeletonRecreateError)
[EXCERPT:SkeletalMesh_SkeletonRecreateError]
