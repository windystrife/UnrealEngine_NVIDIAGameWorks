	_Note: This will add the cube to the **Lift1** group._ 

1. **Right-Click** on the Group (Lift1) again to bring up the context menu, then select **Add New Movement Track**. 

	![](MHT2_Lift1MovementTrack.png)(w:640)

1. When the **Movement Track** is added, a new **Keyframe** will be automatically added at the time **0.00** (see 1 below) along with the track. 

	![](MHT2_MovementTrackExplained.png)(w:640)

	_Note: Section 2 includes the Start/End Markers (Red Triangles), Loop Section (Green Triangles) and **Time Bar** (Black Bar)._ 

1. **Left-Click** on the **Time Bar** and drag it to the time **2.00**, then press the **Enter** key to add a new **Keyframe**. 

	![](MHT2_Lift1SecondKey.png)(w:640)

1. Minimize the Matinee Editor and return to the Level Viewport. With the first cube still selected, move it up next to the second cube. 

	![](MHT2_Lift1MovedUp.png)

	_Note: You should also see the yellow dotted line which indicates the movement the lift will take._

1. In the Matinee Editor, **Left-Click** on the **Keyframe** at **2.00** and press **Control+C** to copy it, then move the **Time Bar** to **3.00** and press **Control+V** to paste it. 

	![](MHT2_Lift1ThirdKeyAdded.png)(w:640)

	_Note: This will allow the lift to stay in the "lifted" position for a second before we return it to the ground._

1. **Left-Click** on the first **Keyframe** at the **0.00** mark and press **Control+C** to copy it, then paste it at both the **4.00** and **5.00** marks. 

	![](MHT2_Lift1Complete.png)(w:640)

	_Note: This will allow the lift to stay in the "lowered" position for a second before we loop the sequence and raise the lift again._

1. Return to the **Main Editor** window and in the **World Outliner** select the **Matinee Actor**. 

	![](MHT2_Matinee1Selected.png)(w:320)

1. In the Details panel for the Matinee Actor, find the **Play** section and check both **Play on Level Load** and **Looping**. 

	![](MHT2_Lift1Details.png)(w:320)

1. If you click the **Play** button to play in the editor, you should see the lift now moving up/down repeatedly, pausing at the top and bottom positions for a second.

		Moving the Second Lift Using the Curve Editor
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:description]
	In this step, we will move the second lift by adjusting Keyframes inside the **Curve Editor**. 
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

1. From the **World Outliner**, select the **Matinee Actor** and in the Details panel, select the **Open Matinee** option. 

	![](MHT2_ReopenMatinee.png)
	
1. Minimize the Matinee window, then in the Level Viewport select the third cube created so that it is highlighted. 

	![](MHT2_SelectThirdPlatform.png)
		
1. Return to the Matinee Editor and **Right-Click** under the **Lift1** group, and in the context menu, select **Add New Empty Group**. 

	![](MHT2_AddSecondGroup.png)(w:640)

1. In the **New Group Name** box, enter a name for this group (In this example, we named the group **Lift2**). 

1. **Right-Click** on the Group (Lift2) in the **Tracks Window** again to bring up the context menu, then select **Add New Movement Track**. 

	![](MHT2_Lift2MovementGroup.png)

1. **Left-Click** on the **Time Bar** and drag it to the **2.00** mark, then press **Enter** to add a new **Keyframe**. 

	![](MHT2_Lift2SecondKey.png)(w:640)

1. Minimize the Matinee window, then in the Level Viewport move the lift to the other side of the wall, next to the last platform as seen below. 

	![](MHT2_Lift2Moved.png)

	_Note: You should see that the movement track goes through the wall which we will fix using the **Curve Editor**._

1. With the **Keyframe** at the **2.00** mark selected, press the **Curve Editor** box next to the little green box highlighted below. 

	![](MHT2_EnableCurveEditor.png)(w:780)

1. The **Curve Editor** should now be displayed in the top window and the **Curve Editor** icon in the **Movement Track** should be highlighted. 

	![](MHT2_CurveTrackAdded.png)(w:780)

1. Press each of the **Toolbar** options highlighted in the box below to adjust the view of the **Curve Editor** so that it is more visible. 

	![](MHT2_ToolBarOptions.png)

	_Note: You can also **Mouse Wheel Up** or **Down** to zoom the graph **In** or **Out** to get a better view._

1. **Right-Click** on the **Keyframe** at the **2.00** mark of **Lift2's Movement Track**, and in the context menu, select **Interp Mode** and **Curve (Break)**. 

	![](MHT2_CurveKey1Break.png)(w:780)

	![](MHT2_MovementBending.png)
	
1. **Left-Click** on the **Keyframe** at the **0.00** mark, then click the **Break** option from the **Toolbar** (see 2 below) and move the little white box (see 1 below) downward to create an arch. 

	![](MHT2_CEAdjustFirstKey.jpg)(w:780)

	_Note: You can switch between the **Keyframes** at 0.00 and 2.00, and continue moving the widget to create a smoother arch._

	![](MHT2_EvenCurve.png)

1. In the Movement Track scrub the **Time Bar** to the **3.00** and **4.00** marks and press **Enter** at each to create **Keyframes**. 

	![](MHT2_Lift2FourthKeyAdded.png)
	
1. With the fourth **Keyframe** selected, in the Level Viewport move the lift back to its original position. 

	![](MHT2_Lift2FourthKeyView.png)

	_Note: The movement track goes back through the wall, so we will need to adjust the curve for the remaining **Keyframes** as we did above._

1. In the Movement Track scrub the **Time Bar** to the **5.00** mark and press **Enter** to create the final **Keyframe**. 

	![](MHT2_FinalKeyFrameAdded.png)(w:780)

1. **Right-Click** on the **Keyframes** at **3.00** and **4.00** and in the context menu, set both to use the **Interp Mode** / **Curve(Break)** option. 

	![](MHT2_FinalCurveBreak.png)(w:780)

1. In the **Curve Editor**, adjust the **Keyframes** at **3.00** and **4.00** as previously performed above to create a curved path as seen below. 

	![](MHT2_LoopComplete.png)(w:780)

1. The reverse movement path, should now be complete. 

	![](MHT2_ReverseCurveComplete.png)

1. When you click the **Play** button from the Main Editor's Toolbar, you should have two lifts that move differently and one that uses a curved path.
