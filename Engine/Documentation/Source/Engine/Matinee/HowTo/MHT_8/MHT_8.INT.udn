	_This is going to serve as our timer and countdown to the explosion we will trigger._

1.	Also, inside the **Details** panel make a note of what the **Location** values are under **Transform** for the text as we will need them in a moment. 

	![](MHT8_TextLocation.png)

1.	In the level viewport with the text still selected, press **Control+W** to duplicate the **Text Render** Actor. 

1.	Inside the **Details** panel for the new Text Render Actor, set **Location** to the same as the other Text Render Actor and set the **Text** to **2**. 

	![](MHT8_2.png)

1.	**Repeat the previous two steps** to create another Text Render Actor. Set it in the same location as the others and set the text to **1**. 

1.	For each of the Text Render Actors in the Details panel under **Rendering**, check the box for **Actor Hidden In Game**. 

	![](MHT8_ActorHiddenInGame.png)

	_We will control the visibility of the Actors through Matinee and what them hidden by default._
