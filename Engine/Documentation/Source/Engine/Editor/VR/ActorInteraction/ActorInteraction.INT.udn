## Placing Actors in the World

In VR mode, you can place Actors in the world using the Content Browser or Place Mode.

**To place an Actor using the Content Browser:**

1. Aim one controller at the other to open the **Quick Select** menu.

1. Aim the free controller at **Content** and squeeze the **Trigger** to open the **Content Browser**.

1. Aim the controller at the asset you want to place an instance of and squeeze the **Trigger** to select it. In the example, we are selecting a barrel Static Mesh.
