The **Camera Rig Rail** Actor can be used to produce fly-through, 360 degree, or any other moving shots by attaching a camera to a rail to move along.
The path for the rail can be defined using a [**Spline Component**](Engine/Components/Shapes/) and in Sequencer, you can keyframe the position along the rail where the camera should be at any given time. 

In this how-to we create a 180 degree rail where the attached camera stays focused on our character. 

## Steps

[REGION:note]
For this how-to, we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** project with **Starter Content** enabled. 
[/REGION]

1.	In your project on the **Modes** panel under **Cinematic**, drag a **Camera Rig Rail** asset into the level.

1.	Also from the **Modes** panel under **Cinematic**, drag in a **Cine Camera Actor**.

1.	In the **World Outliner**, drag-and-drop the **CineCameraActor** onto the **CameraRig_Rail** to attach it.

1.	In the **Details** panel for the **CineCameraActor**, set the **XYZ** for **Location** to **0, 0, 60**. 

	![](Rails04.png)

	This will push the camera up slightly off the ground for our shot. 

1.	Select the **CameraRigRail** in the level, then select and move the end point so the rail moves to the left of the character.

1.	With the end point still selected, hold **Alt** then drag out another point as shown below.

1.	Select and move the red tangents to bend the rail to produce a curved shape. 

	![](Rails07.png)(w:800)

1.	Select and move the second point and its tangents to smooth out the curve.

	![](Rails08.png)(w:800)

1.	Select the last point on the rail, then **Alt** drag out another point and adjust to smooth out the curve as desired. 

	![](Rails09.png)(w:800)

1.	From the Main Toolbar, click **Cinematics** then select **Add Level Sequence**. 

	![](Rails10.png)

1.	Hold **Ctrl** and select the **Camera Rig Rail** and **Cine Camera Actor** then add both to Sequencer. 

	![](Rails11.png)

1.	Click the **Add** button and add a **Camera Cut Track**. 

	![](Rails12.png)

1.	Click the **+ Camera** button and add the **Cine Camera Actor** as the camera to shoot from. 

	![](Rails13.png)(w:900)

	Our shot is now ready to shoot from the Cine Camera Actor attached to our Camera Rig Rail. 

1.	Add a key for the current **Transform** on the **CineCameraActor**. 

	![](Rails14.png)(w:900)

1.	On the **CameraRig_Rail**, click the **+ Track** button and add the **Current Position on Rail** property. 

	![](Rails15.png)

	This value represents the position of the attached camera where **0** is at the start of the rail and **1** is the end of the rail. 

1.	Move the Timeline marker to the end of the Sequence (**150**). 

1.	With the **Camera Rig Rail** selected, in the **Details** panel set the **Current Position on Rail** to **1.0** then add a keyframe. 

	![](Rails16.png)

	You can set this value inside Sequencer on the **Current Position on Rail** track or by clicking the keyframe in the **Details** panel. 

1.	Select the **Cine Camera Actor**, then check **Enable Look at Tracking** for the **ThirdPersonCharacter** with a **Z** offset of **45.0**. 

	![](Rails17.png)

	Here we are setting our camera to always follow the location of the **Actor to Track**, in this case the **ThirdPersonCharacter**. 

1.	Lock the viewport to the **Camera Cut Track** then click the preview play button. 

	
## End Result

You should have something similar where the camera pans 180 degrees around the character. 

[OBJECT:EmbeddedVideo]
[PARAMLITERAL:width]
640
[/PARAMLITERAL]
[PARAMLITERAL:height]
360
[/PARAMLITERAL]
[PARAMLITERAL:videoid]

[/OBJECT]

You could continue to add key frames and points along the **Camera Rig Rail** for a full 360 degree orbit around the character. You could also use the rail for fly-through paths in game level or to highlight something of importance. 

[REGION:tip]
There is an advanced method you can use to work with the **Camera Rig Rail** asset in Sequencer that will automate several of the steps from this how-to. Please see the [**Workflow Shortcuts**](Engine\Sequencer\Workflow\CheatSheet) section for more information.
