Often times in film, you will have several people working on different facets of a scene at the same time. 
Sequencer supports this type of workflow through the **Subscenes Track** which allows you to layer **Level Sequences** on top of each other to produce a final sequence. 

You may have an animator creating the animations for the sequence, while someone else works on the camera and another works on effects which are all part of the same sequence. 
Doing so this way allows people to have their own working Level Sequence and work independently without altering content in other scenes. 

In this example we produce a small scene using the Subscenes Track & Compositing of multiple Level Sequences. 


## Steps

[REGION:note]
For this how-to, we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** project with **Starter Content** enabled. 
[/REGION]

1.	Inside your project in the **Content Browser** create **5** Level Sequence assets. 

	![](SubTrack1.png)

	Above, we created a folder called **Sequences** for organizational purposes and created our Level Sequence assets inside it. 

	In this example, we created a **MasterSequence** which would hold all of our shots and be used to create the full cinematic sequence. 
	We create **Shot_01** as the first shot of that sequence and anticipate that we will have 3 people working on it. 
	We then created sequences for each person **e01 - e03** which will be layered to compose the final **Shot_01** sequence. 

1.	**Double-click** to open **Shot_01**, then add a **Sub Track** inside Sequencer. 

	![](SubTrack2.png)

1.	Click the **+ Sequence** button and add **Shot_01_e01**. 

	![](SubTrack3.png)

1.	Add **Shot_01_e02** and **Shot_01_e03** to the **Subscenes Track** and drag them so they appear on top of each other. 

	![](SubTrack4.png)

	When we play **Shot_01** each of these Subscenes will play concurrently with whatever content they have inside them. 

1.	In the **Content Browser** under **Content/Mannequin/Character/Mesh**, drag the **SK_Mannequin** into the level. 

	![](SubTrack5.png)

1.	In **Sequencer**, **Double-click** on the **Shot_01_e01** Subscene to open it then add the **SK_Mannequin** to the scene. 

	![](SubTrack6.png)

1.	Click the **+** sign on the **Animation** track and add the **ThirdPersonWalk** animation then stretch it to fill the sequence. 

	![](SubTrack7.png)

1.	On the **Location** track add a key at **0** for the current position, at **150** move the **SK_Mannequin** forward add key the new position. 

	![](SubTrack8.png)

	[REGION:tip]
	Need a refresher to working with Sequencer Transforms, see [](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksCameraCut) for more information.
	[/REGION]

1.	Use the breadcrumbs to return to **Shot_01**, move the Timeline back to **0** then **Double-click** on **Shot_01_e02** to open it.

	![](SubTrack9.png)

	You will also notice now that **Shot_01_e01** has 1 track added to it (the **SK_Mannequin** Skeletal Mesh track). 

1.	Add a **Subscenes Track** and add **Shot_01_e01** (this will be used for referencing the animation). 

1.	Click the **Add Camera** button to add a camera and then create a path to follow the movement of the character.

	Since we are working in our own scene, we are not affecting our animators work in **Shot_01_e01** but simply referencing it so that we can set up our camera movement.
	This makes it easier to see and work with others content without working inside it.
	The alternative method is to jump back up to the **Shot_01** level to see how the scenes are playing with one another. 

1.	Delete the **Subscenes** and **Camera Cuts** tracks from **Shot_01_e02**. 

	The Subscene Track we added was for movement reference, if we leave it in it will affect the overall transform as seen below.

	![](SubTrack11.png)

	After deleting the Subscenes Track in **Shot_01_e02**, the transform is correct.

	![](SubTrack12.png)

	The viewport is locked to the camera assigned in the Camera Cuts track so we are removing this for now so we can continue to work. 

1.	Open the **Shot_01_e03** scene and add a **Subscene Track** with **Shot_01_e01**. 

	![](SubTrack13.png)

	In this sequence our FX artist is going to add effects each time the character walks so we need reference to the movement, similar to what we just did with the camera work. 
	Again, when we are done with the reference we will need to delete it otherwise it will affect the Transform on the **Shot_01** level. 

1.	Add an **Event Track** and add keys called **FootStep** each time the character steps on the ground.

	Above we added an Event called FootStep, then copied and pasted it each time the character walked. 
	While this particular effect could be accomplished by creating an [**Anim Notify**](Engine/Animation/Sequences/Notifies) as well, this demonstrates how an FX artist could use their own track to apply other types of effects for your scenes. 

1. **Delete** the **Subscenes Track** after setting up the Event Track.

1.	Select the **SK_Mannequin** in the level, then click the **Blueprints** button and **Open Level Blueprint** from the Toolbar. 

	![](SubTrack15.png)

	We need to specify what happens when the Events from our Event Track are called. 

1.	**Right-click** in the graph and create a reference to the **SK_Mannequin**. 

	![](SubTrack16.png)

1.	**Right-click** and create a **Custom Event** called **FootStep** then **Right-click** again and **Spawn Emitter at Location**. 

	![](SubTrack17.png)

1.	Use **P_Explosion** as the **Emitter Template**, drag off the **SK_Mannequin** and **Get Actor Location** and connect as shown. 

	![](SubTrack18.png)

1.	Back in the **Content Browser**, drag the **Shot_01** into the level. 

	![](SubTrack19.png)

1.	In the **Details** panel for the **Shot_01** Level Sequence, check the **Auto Play** option.

	![](SubTrack20.png)

1.	Click the **Play** Button to play in the Editor. 

## End Result

When playing in the editor, you will see that the character walks forward and spawns an explosion with each step.

The example above does not include the camera work which can be added with one minor modification inside the **Shot_01_e02** track.

By re-adding the **Camera Cuts Track** and pointing to the CameraActor, we determine which camera should be used for the scene. 
The person working on the camera could continue to make modifications to the scene if they wanted such as adjusting the path of the camera movement. 
Those changes would only occur inside the **Shot_01_e02** track and can be made without changing elements in the other tracks. 

Our final composited scene plays out when we play in the level.

Using Subscenes is an efficient way of generating content when multiple people are involved as it allows those individuals to create there content without everyone working in the same Level Sequence.
