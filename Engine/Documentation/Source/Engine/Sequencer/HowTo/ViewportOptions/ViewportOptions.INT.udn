There are some specialized viewports you can enable which will give you the ability to preview your cinematics in real-time.
This guide will show you where you can access and turn on those viewports and how to enable the Viewport Playback Controls and Viewport Options menus. 

## Steps

[REGION:note]
For this how-to, we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** project. However, you can use any project you wish.

1.	Inside any viewport click the **View Mode** button, then select **Cinematic Viewport**.

	This will turn the selected viewport into a Cinematic Viewport.

	You may get a warning at the bottom of the viewport if there is no Level Sequence currently open.

1.	From the main toolbar, click **Cinematics** then select **Add Level Sequence**.

	Sequencer will automatically open and you will now have [**Playback Controls**](Engine\Sequencer\ReferenceEditor\) inside the Cinematic Viewport. 

1.	Click the Viewport Options drop-down, then under **Layouts** select the side-by-side **Two Pane** layout.

	This will reset the viewports which we can re-enable with keyboard shortcuts. 

1.	In the left window, press **Alt+G** then in the right window, press **Shift+C**.

	**Shift+C** turns the active viewport into a Cinematic Viewport (**Shift+D** returns it to a default viewport). 

1.	Click the Viewport Options drop-down again, then check the **Game View** option.

	This will put the viewport into [Game View](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Viewports/Basics) (**G** key shortcut) which will hide all editor icons. 

1.	Click the Viewport Options once more, then un-check the **Show Toolbar** option.

	This will turn off the viewport tool bar which includes editor gizmos that you may not need in your Cinematic Viewport. 

1.	Click the **Cinematic Viewport Overlay** option button.

	 You can use the viewport overlays to help frame up your scenes or view safe areas.
