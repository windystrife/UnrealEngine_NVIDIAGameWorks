The **Play Rate Track** will allow you to speed up or slow down sections of your Level Sequence. 
You can add keyframes at any point in your scene where you want a shift in Play Rate to occur (maybe you want to slow down time to show off an important moment or increase the playback rate to heighten certain scenes). 

In this guide we will adjust the Play Rate to slow down time during our scene. 

## Steps

[REGION:note]
For this how-to, we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** project with **Starter Content** enabled. 
[/REGION]

1.	From the Main Toolbar click the **Cinematics** button then **Add Level Sequence**.

	Enter a save name and save location for the asset which will automatically be added to the Level and **Content Browser**. 

1.	Inside the Sequencer Editor, click the **Add** button and select the **Play Rate Track**.

1.	Select the **Play Rate** track, then press **Enter** to add a keyframe at the **0** marker.

	Above we are adding the default value for Play Rate of **1.0** (which means normal Play Back rate). 

1.	Move the Timeline Marker to **25**, then change the Play Rate Value to **0.25** and press **Enter** to add a key.

1.	Add a key at **75** with a value of **0.25** and a key at **100** with a value of **1.0**.

	Above we are going from 1 to 0.25 then staying at 0.25 for several frames before returning to our normal 1.0 Play Rate. 

	[REGION:tip]
	You can **Right-click** drag to move around in the Tracks Area and **CTRL + Mouse Wheel** in/out to zoom in/out. 
	[/REGION]

1.	On the **Content Browser** tab under **Content/Mannequin/Character/Mesh**, drag the **SK_Mannequin** into the level.

	We will add this Skeletal Mesh to Sequencer and tell it to play an animation so we can see it being affected by the Play Rate shift. 

1.	Return to **Sequencer** and with the **SK_Mannequin** still selected in the level, click the **Add** button and add it to the Level Sequence.

1.	Move the Timeline Marker back to **0**, then under the **SK_Mannequin** click the **+ Animation** button and add the **ThirdPersonWalk**. 

	![](PlayRate8.png)

1.	**Left-click** drag the animation to the right to loop it for the duration of the scene.

1.	Click the **Preview Play** button in the Level Viewport to preview the sequence.

You will notice as the scene starts we start the shift in Play Rate from 1.0 (normal speed) down to 0.25 speed. We stay there for a few frames to play a section in slow motion before ramping back up to or normal Play Rate. 

While this example showcases how to slow down the Play Rate, you can increase the Play Rate value above 1.0 to increase the speed of your scenes. Feel free to experiment with values and ranges to get your desired effect.
