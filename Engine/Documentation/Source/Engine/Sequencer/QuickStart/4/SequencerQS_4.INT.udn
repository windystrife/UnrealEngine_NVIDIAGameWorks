Now that you have completed your first shot, let's take what we have learned and create another!

This time we will push the camera in from the front of our character in on their face. 

## Steps

1.	In the **Content Browser**, select the **Shot01** Level Sequence and press **Shift+W** to duplicate it.

	Shot01 already has most of the existing content we want to use in the second shot. 

1.	Inside **Shot02**, delete the existing **CineCameraActor** and click the **Add Camera** button to automatically assign it on the Camera Cuts track and enter the camera in Pilot Mode.

## End Result

We have set up our second shot of our sequence where the camera starts from far away and pushes in on the character. 

In our next step, we tie our shots together using the **Shot Track** in our Master Level Sequence. We also create a **Take** (or variation) of one of our shots that we can quickly swap in or out. You will see how we can arrange the order of shots in our scene as we get a little bit closer to finishing our sample scene.
