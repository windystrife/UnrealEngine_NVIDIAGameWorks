Unreal Engine 4 comes with two fully-integrated methods that allow people to work together on their projects using version control software like Perforce and SVN. 
Version control allows users on your team to share assets and code with one another, as well as providing a backup and history of changes so any files can 
be rolled back to an earlier version if something went wrong with the file.
