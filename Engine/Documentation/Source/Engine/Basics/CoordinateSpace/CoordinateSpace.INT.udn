## Spaces

| Space in Unreal | Other Names | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Tangent** | | Orthogonal (can deviate after interpolation), can be left or right handed. The TangentToLocal transform contains rotation only, so it is OrthoNormal (can be inverted by transposing). |
| **Local** | **Object Space** | Orthogonal, can be left or right handed (triangle cull order needs adjustment). The LocalToWorld transform contains rotation, non-uniform scaling (including negative non-uniform scaling which can change the winding order), and translation. |
| **World** | | The WorldToView transform contains only rotation and translation, so distances in View space are the same as in World space. |
| **TranslatedWorld** | | [INCLUDE:#TranslatedWorld] Translated matrices are used to remove camera position from the combined transform matrices, which improves precision when transforming vertices. |
| **View** | **CameraSpace** | The ViewToClip transform contains scale on x and y, but no translation (which would be an off center projection). It scales and translates z. It also applies a projection to convert into the homogeneous ClipSpace. |
| **Clip** | **HomogeniousCoordinates**, **PostProjectionSpace**, **ProjectionSpace** | After the perspective projection matrix was applied.  Note that W in Clip space is the same as View Space Z. |
| **Screen** | **NormalizedDeviceCoordinates** from OpenGL | [INCLUDE:#Screen] |
| **Viewport** | **ViewportCoordinates**, **WindowCoordinates** | [INCLUDE:#Viewport] |

## Space Transformations

Transformation between spaces should always be named using the form **_X To Y_**.

**Examples:**

* WorldToView
* TranslatedWorldToView
* TangentToWorld
