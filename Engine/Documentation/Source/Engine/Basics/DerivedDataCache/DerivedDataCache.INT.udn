Description: Overview of the Derived Data Cache and the storage of assets in formats used by UE4 and its target platforms. 
version: 4.9
Parent:Engine
type:overview
order:24

The **Derived Data Cache** (DDC) stores versions of assets in the formats used by the engine and its 
target platforms, as opposed to the source formats artists create that are imported into the editor 
and stored in .uasset files. Content stored in the DDC is disposable in that it can always be 
regenerated at any time using the data stored in the .uasset file. Storing these derived formats 
externally makes it possible to easily add or change the formats used by the engine without needing to 
modify the source asset file.

## Using a Shared DDC

Studios should use a shared DDC that all users in a particular location can access. This way, only one 
person needs to build the derived asset format(s) and they are automatically available to all other 
users. There will occasionally be stalls when assets need to be processed, but the results are remembered 
and shared. So with a handful of developers or more, most people will not notice any impact.

[REGION:warning]
Never copy an entire DDC across the internet, back up your DDC, or restore a DDC from a backup. This will 
not do any harm, but it is a waste of time as it generally takes longer to transfer the amount of data stored 
in the DDC than it would to simply generate it from scratch locally.
[/REGION]

To set up a shared DDC, override the paths for the `[InstalledDerivedDataBackendGraph]` or `[DerivedDataBackendGraph]` (depending on whether you use the binary install from the Epic Game Launcher or compile from source) by declaring this 
section in your game's **DefaultEngine.ini**. This section is originally declared in the **BaseEngine.ini** 
where the paths are set to Epic's internal DDC share. Re-declare the section and change the paths to point 
to a share on your network (e.g. `Path=\\mystudio.net\DDC`):

Satellite studios working out of a single shared code base can set the **UE-SharedDataCachePath** environment 
variable to a path that all users at each location can read and write to. This allows each location to 
have its own shared DDC. 

For example:

	UE-SharedDataCachePath=\\mystudio.net\DDC

## Using a Local DDC

Lone developers or developers working remotely generally just use a local DDC. To tell the engine not to 
try and use a shared DDC, use one of the methods below:

* Pass `-ddc=noshared` on the command line.
* Set the environment variable to a local drive hard drive: 
    
		UE-SharedDataCachePath=c:\DDC


## Building Derived Data

Generally, the user who imports the asset is the one who builds the derived data since they will most 
likely be using and testing them out in the engine. However, there may be occasions when a new asset 
needs to be processed. This happens automatically on an as-needed basis and should not result in much 
of an impact when running fast hardware, though there may be occasional stalls.
 
You can fill your derived data caches at any time by passing the arguments below to the executable:
 
	UE4\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UE4Editor.exe MyGame -run=DerivedDataCache -fill 

We do this on a nightly basis to ensure the DDC is always primed, but it is not necessary in general 
as the automatic caching should just work.

## Distributing with a DDC
 
Cooking is generally the preferred method for packaging games since cooked builds do not need nor use a DDC. However, 
DDCs can be packaged for distribution if the need arises.

**To package a DDC:**
 
1. Run the **UE4Editor.exe** from the UE4/Engine/Binaries/Win64 directory passing it the arguments shown below:

		UE4Editor.exe [GameName] -run=DerivedDataCache -fill -DDC=CreatePak
 
1. This creates a **DDC.ddp** file in the UE4\[GameName]\DerivedDataCache

1. The engine automatically detects and uses the .ddp file.
