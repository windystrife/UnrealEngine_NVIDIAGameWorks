[EXCERPT:intro]
The best way to think of **Paper 2D Flipbooks** (or **Flipbooks** for short) is in the form of hand-drawn animation, where a series of images that are slightly different are "flipped" through to produce what appears to be motion. In Unreal Engine 4, Flipbooks consist of a series of key frames, each of which contains a [Sprite](Engine\Paper2D\Sprites) to be displayed and a duration (in frames) to display it. 
A **Frames Per Second** option determines how fast the frames will be displayed, indicating how many animation "beats" will occur in a second and the key frames themselves can be edited in the **Details** panel or by using a **Timeline** which can be found at the bottom of the **Flipbook Editor**.

## Creating a Flipbook

There are a couple of ways you can go about creating a Flipbook. You can either create a blank Flipbook that you populate with sprites yourself or you can auto-generate a Flipbook based off a series of selected sprites. 

[REGION:note]
You can import a JSON formatted sprite sheet description, which will import associated textures and create sprites and a Flipbook for the described frames as well. See [](Engine\Paper2D\Importing) for more information.

### Blank Flipbooks

Creating a blank Flipbook can be achieved by following the steps below. 

**From the Content Browser**: 

1.	Click the **Add New** button, then in the context menu under _Animation_, select the **Paper Flipbook** option.

	[REGION:note]
	You can also **Right-click** inside the **Content Browser** to open the context menu instead of clicking **Add New**. 
	[/REGION]

1.	You will then be prompted to enter a name for your new Flipbook.

1.	After you select a name, your Flipbook asset has been created.

	The asterisk symbol in the lower-left corner indicates that the asset has not been saved yet and will go away when you save it. 

### Auto-Generated Flipbooks

To create an automatically generated Flipbook, follow the steps below. 

**From the Content Browser**: 

1.	Locate and select each of the sprites you would like to include in the Flipbook in the **Content Browser**.

1.	**Right-click** on any of the sprites, then select the **Create Flipbook** option from the context menu.

1.	You will then be prompted to enter a name for your new Flipbook.

1.	After you select a name, your Flipbook asset has been created.

	When you mouse over the Flipbook in the **Content Browser**, you will also be able to preview the Flipbook animation. 

[REGION:warning]
When auto-generating a Flipbook, the naming convention you use for the sprites included is **very important** as the sprites will be added to the Flipbook in alphabetical order. In the example above, we've named each of our sprites for creating an Idle to **Idle_x** where X is the order in which we want the sequence to appear.
