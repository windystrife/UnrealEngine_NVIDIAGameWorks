In this how-to we play a video on a Static Mesh inside the level when we start the game. 
Our source video will come from a provided URL stream and we use some **Blueprint Visual Script** to open the stream and start playback once we load into the level. 
The end result is a video playing inside our level where the source comes from our assigned URL similar to below.

## Steps

[REGION:note]
For this how-to we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** project with **Starter Content** enabled.
[/REGION]

1.	In the **Content Browser** expand the **Sources Panel** then create a new folder called **Media** inside the **Content** folder.

1.	Click the **Add New** button, then under **Media**, select **Stream Media Source** and name the asset **MediaStream**.

1.	Open **MediaStream** then enter your desired **Stream URL**. 

	![](StreamMedia_03.png) 

	If you do not have a URL file to link to, **Right-click** this [Sample Video](Infiltrator Demo.mp4) and copy the link address and paste it in the Stream URL field.
	
	[REGION:note]
	Your Stream URL must link directly to a supported format in order to play back the video. 
	For example, PS4Media (PS4) only supports MP4 through HLS right now, while WmfMedia (Windows) can support a number of other stream sources. 
	For futher information on supported formats per platform/player plug-in, see the [](Engine\MediaFramework\TechReference\) page. 
	[/REGION]

1.	Click the **Add New** button, then under **Media**, select the **Media Player** asset. 

	![](StreamMedia_04.png)

1.	In the **Create Media Player** window, check **Audio output SoundWave asset** and **Video output Media Texture asset**. 

	![](StreamMedia_05.png)

	This will automatically create a Sound Wave and Media Texture asset linked to this Media Player asset which is needed for playback.
	
1. Name the new Media Player Asset. We have called our Media Player asset **SampleStream** which is also applied to the Sound Wave and Media Texture.

1.	In the **Content Browser** under **StarterContent/Shapes** drag a **Shape_Plane** into the level. We will use this Static Mesh to playback our video on.

	![](StreamMedia_07.png) 

1.	Use the **Translate (W)**, **Rotation (E)** and **Scale (R)** tools to adjust the mesh to your desired size and location.

1.	Hold **Ctrl** then select both the **Sound Wave** and **Media Texture** assets and drop them on top of the **Static Mesh** in the level. 

	![](StreamMedia_08.png) 

	This will automatically create a **Material** and apply it to the Static Mesh.

1.	From the Toolbar, click the **Blueprints** button and **Open Level Blueprint**. 

	![](StreamMedia_09.png)

1.	Add a **Variable** of the **Media Player Reference** type called **Media Player** and set it to your **SampleStream** Media Player asset. 

	![](StreamMedia_10.png)

	[REGION:note]
	You may need to **Compile** before you can assign the **Default Value**. 
	[/REGION]

1.	Hold **Ctrl** and drag in the **MediaPlayer** variable and also **Right-click** and add an **Event Begin Play** node. 

	![](StreamMedia_11.png)

1.	Drag off the **MediaPlayer** variable and use the **Open Source** node set to your **MediaStream** Media Source then connect as shown. 

	![](StreamMedia_12.png)

1.	Close the Level Blueprint, then **Play** in the editor. 

	
## End Result

When you play in the editor, the video will start playing on the Static Mesh.

Similar to using a [File Media Source](Engine\MediaFramework\HowTo\FileMediaSource) which plays a video file from disk, Stream Media Sources will automatically play when calling **Open Source** if their associated **Media Player** asset are set to **Play on Open** which by default is enabled.
There are additional commands you can issue to the Media Player asset such as pausing, rewinding or stopping the video once it has begun playing which can be found under the **Media Player** section when dragging off the Media Player Reference.
