When working with media assets in Unreal Engine 4, there may be times where you have a series of videos that you want to playback in a specific order or you want to allow players to access videos within a specific series of videos. 
This can be accomplished by using a **Media Playlist** asset which points to **Media Source** assets assigned in a predefined order. 

In this how-to we create a Media Playlist and allow the player to playback each asset or access a specific asset inside the playlist through a key press similar to the video below.

## Steps

[REGION:note]
For this how-to we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** project with **Starter Content** enabled.
You will also need a few [Supported Video Files](Engine\MediaFramework\TechReference) saved on our computer that you want to add to the playlist for playback. 
You can use your own or **Right-click** and download these two sample videos: [Video Example 1](Infiltrator Demo.mp4) and [Video Example 2](SampleVideo.mp4)
[/REGION]

1.	In the **Content Browser** expand the **Sources Panel**, then in the **Content** create a new folder called **Movies**.

1.	**Right-click** on the **Movies** folder and choose **Show in Explorer** then place your video files in the folder.

	[REGION:note]
	Placing your video files inside the **Content/Movies** folder of your project will ensure the videos are properly packaged. 
	[/REGION]

1.	Create two **File Media Source** assets (called **Video_01** and **Video_02**) and point the **File Path** to each respective video. 

	![](Playlist_02.png)

1.	Create a **Media Playlist** asset inside the content browser called **MyPlaylist**. 

	![](Playlist_03.png)

1.	Inside **MyPlaylist**, **Double-click** on each **File Media Source** to add it to the playlist. 

	![](Playlist_04.png)

	You can also use the **+** button to add an empty element which you can then assign your source media. In this example we are using **File Media Source** assets, however you can also include **Stream Media Source** assets in a Playlist. 

1.	Create a **Media Player** asset called **VideoPlayer**. 

	![](Playlist_05.png)

1.	In the **Create Media Player** window, check **Audio output SoundWave asset** and **Video output Media Texture asset**. 

	![](Playlist_06.png)

	This will automatically create a Sound Wave and Media Texture asset linked to this Media Player asset which is needed for playback. 

	![](Playlist_07.png)

1.	In the **Content Browser** under **StarterContent/Shapes** drag a **Shape_Plane** into the level.  

	![](Playlist_09.png)

1.	Use the **Translate (W)**, **Rotation (E)** and **Scale (R)** tools to adjust the size and location of the Static Mesh as desired. 

1.	Hold **Ctrl** then select both the **Sound Wave** and **Media Texture** assets and drop them on top of the **Static Mesh** in the level. 

	![](Playlist_10.png)

	This will automatically create a **Material** and apply it to the Static Mesh. 

1.	From the Toolbar, click the **Blueprints** button and **Open Level Blueprint**. 

	![](Playlist_11.png)

1.	Add a **Variable** of the **Media Player Reference** type called **Media Player** and set it to your **VideoPlayer** Media Player asset.

	![](Playlist_12.png)

	[REGION:note]
	You may need to **Compile** before you can assign the **Default Value**. 
	[/REGION]

1.	**Right-click** in the **Event Graph** and add a **1 Keyboard Event**, **2 Keyboard Event** and **3 Keyboard Event**.  

	![](Playlist_13.png)

1.	**Ctrl** drag in the **Media Player** variable, then drag off it and use **Open Playlist Index** and set the **InPlaylist** to **MyPlaylist**. 

	![](Playlist_14.png)

1.	Use **Open Playlist** for the **2 Keyboard Event** with **Index** set to **1** and use **Open Playlist** for the **3 Keyboard Event**. 

	![](Playlist_15.png)

1.	Close the **Level Blueprint**, then click the **Play** button to play in the level.

When playing in the editor, the video playback will not initially start when the level is loaded. When the player presses the **1** key, the playlist will start playing from the first video in the playlist. 
When pressing the **2** key, the video playback will jump to the second video in the playlist. When pressing **3**, we are opening and playing the video from the start of the playlist which is the same as opening the playlist at index 0. 

Our **Media Player** asset is set to **Play on Open** which is why each video is played when we call the open playlist function. 
If you want to open a Media Source but not start playback immediately, you can uncheck the Play on Open option inside the Media Player asset then use the **Play** function to play an open Media Source asset. 

You can also navigate an opend playlist with the **Next** function (to pick the next item in the playlist) and **Previous** (to pick the previous item in the playlist). 
The Media Player also has a property called **Shuffle** that when enabled will pick a random item from the playlist when the next source is to be opened (also affects Previous and Next).
