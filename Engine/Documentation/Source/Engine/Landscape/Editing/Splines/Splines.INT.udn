[TOC(start:2)]

The **Spline** tool creates a spline Actor that deforms a terrain mesh along it, such as for creating flat roads through mountainous terrain.

[EXCERPT:Splines001]

[EXCERPT:LandscapeSplines]
**Landscape Splines** are a flexible system for creating any linear feature that needs to conform to a Landscape, and can even push and pull the terrain to better facilitate building these features. They are created and edited using the spline tool in the Landscape tool.
[/EXCERPT:LandscapeSplines]

The Spline tool is best used to make streets or paths in the environment, but in general, it can be used for any mesh that must conform to the terrain, such as cobblestone walls or long straight rows of corn.

## Creating a Spline

**To create a spline:**

1. In **Manage** mode, select the **Edit Splines** tool.

	![Spline Tool](Landscape_SplineTool.png)

1. On the currently selected Landscape, press **Ctrl + Left-click** to set your spline's first control point. The control point's sprite looks like a bumpy, brown-and-white boulder.

1. Press **Ctrl + Left-click** again to create another control point, connected to the first by a spline segment. The selection changes to the new control point so that you can repeat this to add more control points.

**To join two splines:**

* Select one spline and then **Ctrl + Left-click** on the other.


**To split a spline:**

* Press **Ctrl + Left-click** on a segment. This splits the segment at that point and inserts a new control point.

You can assign a Static Mesh Actor to follow along your spline's segments.

**To add a Static Mesh Actor to a spline:**

1. In the **Content Browser**, find and select the Static Mesh asset that you want to use with your spline.

1. Click on a spline control point on your Landscape.

1. In the Level Editor's **Details** panel, in the **Landscape Spline** section, next to **Select all connected**, click **Segments**. This will make sure that the Static Mesh is added to all the spline's segments.

	![All Segments](Landscape_SplineAllSegments.png)

1. In the **Landscape Spline Meshes** section, under **Spline Meshes**, if there is no element, click the plus icon (![Plus Icon](Engine/Landscape/Materials/icon_Landscape_PlusSign.png)) to add one.

	![Add Mesh](Landscape_SplineMeshAdd.png)

1. Expand the element you just added. Next to **Mesh**, click the Assign arrow icon (![Assign](Shared/Icons/icon_assign_left_16x.png)) to assign the selected Static Mesh.

[REGION:tip]
If you want to, you can also assign a Static Mesh to an individual control point by selecting that control point and assigning the Static Mesh in the **Details** panel, in the **Mesh** section.

## Editing a Spline


Spline control points respond as you would expect to the translation and rotation tools, but the scale tool brings up a different UI:

![Segment tangent scale tool](segment_scale.jpg)(w:785 h:516 type:jpg)

These are the spline tangents. If a segment is selected, it shows the tangents at each end of the segment, and if a control point is selected, it shows the tangents of all connected segments.
You can adjust the scale of the tangent by dragging the end of it, which alters how curved the segment of spline is.


## Applying Splines to the Landscape

The **Apply Splines to Landscape** button modifies the Landscape heightmap and layer weightmaps with the spline information.
The heightmap is raised or lowered to fit the spline, with a smooth cosine-blended falloff on either side. This is controlled by the width and falloff properties of the spline control points, and the **Raise/Lower Terrain** option on the individual spline segments.
The Texture layer that is painted (if any) is specified in the **Layer Name** property of the individual spline segments, and the painting is affected by the spline width and falloff settings in the control points.


## Spline Properties

The properties of the selected control points or segments are displayed in the Level Editor's **Details** panel.

### Control Point Properties

| Property | Description |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| **Location**      | Position of the control point relative to the Landscape it is attached to.
| **Rotation**      | Rotation of the control point, controls the direction of the tangent of any attached spline segments at this point.
| **Width**         | Width of the spline at this point. Shown as solid lines. Affects all connected segments.
| **Side Falloff**  | The width of the cosine-blended falloff region on either side of the spline at this point. Shown as dotted lines.
| **End Falloff**   | Only relevant at the end of a spline (a control point with only one attached segment), the length of the cosine-blended falloff region that smoothly ends the spline segment.
| **Layer Name**    | Name of the blendmask layer to paint to when the spline is applied to the Landscape.
| **Raise Terrain** | Raises the Landscape to match spline when the spline is applied to the Landscape. Good for roads on embankments.
| **Lower Terrain** | Lowers the Landscape to match spline when the spline is applied to the Landscape. Good for rivers and ditches.

### Spline Segment Properties

<!--

Sub Tables for the property table below

[EXCERPT:SplineSegProp001]
| ---- | ---- |
| **Connections Sub-Properties** ||
| Tangent Len | Scale of the tangent at this point, controls how curved the segment is. Negative tangents cause the segment to connect to the back of the control point. |
| Socket Name | Socket on the control point this segment end is connected to. |
[/EXCERPT:SplineSegProp001]

[EXCERPT:SplineSegProp002]
| ---- | ---- |
| **Spline Meshes Sub-Properties (per mesh used)**  ||
| Mesh           | The Static Mesh to use. |
| Material Overrides | Overrides the Static Mesh's assigned Material with a different Material for the spline. |
| Center H       | Whether to horizontally center the mesh on the spline or use the mesh's origin. |
| Offset         | Offsets the mesh from the spline (units are in mesh-space, unscaled by the spline). |
| Scale to Width | Whether to scale the mesh to fit the spline width or to use the mesh as-is. |
| Scale          | Multiplier to the size of the mesh. If **Scale to Width** is enabled, the **Scale** specified here is relative to the spline width; otherwise, it is relative to the mesh's natural size. |
| Forward Axis   | Chooses the forward axis of the **Spline Mesh**. |
| Up Axis        | Chooses the Up axis of the **Spline Mesh**. |
