The **Flatten** tool pushes or pulls all other parts of the heightmap to the level that is currently under the mouse when activated. This can raise or lower the surrounding 
heightmap values to be the same value. 

## Using the Flatten Tool

In this example, the Flatten tool is being used in the middle of the hillside to flatten out areas at the point where the mouse click was initiated. As long as the mouse is held down, the height value 
that was detected is used along any surface to raise or lower (depending on your tool settings) to that height.


Use the following controls to sculpt your Landscape heightmap:

| **Controls** | **Operation** |
| --- | --- |
| **Left Mouse Button** | Flattens or levels by both raising and lowering or individually raising and lowering the heightmap. |

The brush strength determines the amount of Flattening that can happen when using the Flatten tool.
