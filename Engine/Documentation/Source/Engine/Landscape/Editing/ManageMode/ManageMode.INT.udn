[TOC(start:2 end:3)]

In **Manage** mode, you can create new Landscapes, and you can use the component tools to modify an existing Landscape's components. You can also select components and modify their properties in the Level Editor's **Details** panel.

For information about creating Landscapes, see [](Engine/Landscape\Creation).

[REGION:tip]
Landscape Manage Mode also works in the VR Editor. For the controls for using Landscape in VR, see the [](Engine/Editor/VR/Controls).
[/REGION]


## Landscape Selection

In the **Landscape** tool, in any mode, you can select which Landscape you want to modify from a list of all the Landscapes currently in your level.

![](Landscape_Select_Different_LS.png)

**To select a Landscape:**

* In the Landscape tool, in the **Landscape Editor** section, click the **Landscape** drop-down box to display a list of all Landscapes currently in the map.
* Choose the Landscape you want to edit.

Selecting a Landscape from the list makes that the active Landscape. All subsequent editing will then be applied to that Landscape.
## Components

**Components** are the building blocks of Landscapes.  You can work with them with Component tools, and you can also adjust their properties individually in the Level Editor's **Details** panel.

### Component Tools

The tools described below act on the component level of the current Landscape.

#### Selection

![Landscape Selection](Landscape_Selection.png)

The **Selection** tool selects Landscape components, one at a time, for subsequent use with other tools, such as moving the components to streaming levels and deleting components.

| **Control** | **Operation** |
| --- | --- |
| **Left Mouse Button click** | Toggles the selection of the component. |
| **Shift + Left Mouse Button click** | De-Selects components. |


The selection cursor is always limited to one component:

![selection_cursor.jpg](Engine/Landscape/Editing/Brushes/selection_cursor.jpg)(w:900 h:453)

When components have been selected, they become shaded red:

![selection_components.jpg](selection_components.jpg)(w:900 h:453)

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Clear Component Selection** | Clears the current selected component(s). |


#### Add

![Add Component](Landscape_Add.png)

The **Add** tool creates new components for the current Landscape, one at a time.

| **Control** | **Operation** |
| --- | --- |
| **Left Mouse Button click** | Adds a new component. |

When the Add Landscape Component tool is active, the cursor shows a green wireframe where new components can be added:

![selection_add_cursor.jpg](selection_add_cursor.jpg)(w:900 h:453)

Using the tool adds a new component where the cursor is located:

![selection_add.jpg](selection_add.jpg)(w:900 h:453)


#### Delete

![Delete Component](Landscape_Delete.png)

The **Delete** tool deletes selected components.

| **Control** | **Operation** |
| --- | --- |
| **Left Mouse Button click** | Deletes selected components selected by the Selection tool. If no components are currently selected, deletes the component highlighted by moving the mouse cursor over it. |


![selection_remove_cursor.jpg](selection_remove_cursor.jpg)(w:900 h:453)

Using the tool removes the selected components:

If you want more control over what areas of your Landscape the player can get through. Check out the [Landscape Hole Material](Engine/Landscape/Materials#landscapeholematerials).
[/REGION]

#### Move Level

![Move Level](Landscape_MoveLevel.png)

This tool moves the selected components, via using the Selection tool, to the current streaming level. This makes it possible to move sections of a Landscape into a streaming level so that they will be streamed in and out with that level, optimizing the performance of the Landscape.

When the streaming level is visible, the Landscape renders all the components:

![selection_movestream_visible.jpg](selection_movestream_visible.jpg)(w:900 h:453)

You can toggle the visibility of the level by clicking the eye icon (![Level Window Eye Icon](icon_Landscape_LevelWindowEye.png)) for that level in the **Levels** window (accessible on the Level Editor's **Window** menu). Doing so causes the components in that level to no longer be rendered:

![selection_movestream_invisible.jpg](selection_movestream_invisible.jpg)(w:900 h:453)


#### Change Component Size

[INCLUDE:Shared/LandscapeEditor#resizelandscape]

![Component Size](Landscape_ComponentSize.png)

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Section Size** | Use the drop-down box to select the number of quads you want in your Landscape's sections. |
| **Sections Per Component** | Use the drop-down box to specify whether you want your Landscape to contain **1x1** or **2x2** sections per component. |
| **Resize Mode** | Specify whether, when you apply your resizing changes, you want to **Expand** (enlarge) or **Clip** (shrink) the Landscape. |

After you have set your resizing options, click **Apply** to apply them.

#### Edit Splines

![Edit Splines](Landscape_EditSplines.png)

[INCLUDE:Engine/Landscape/Editing/Splines/#LandscapeSplines]

For information about how to create and modify spline curves, see [](Engine/Landscape\Editing\Splines).

### Component Properties

You can set the properties of components, including LODs and component-specific Materials, in the Level Editor's **Details** panel.

#### Component LODs

You can set LODs for selected component, which means an individual component can have its own LOD settings.

**To set LODs for selected component:**

1. Select the components whose LODs you want to set. For information about selecting components, see [Selection](#Selection).

1. In the Level Editor's **Details** panel, under **Landscape Component**, change the **Forced LOD** and **LODBias** settings to what you want them to be.

	![](Landscape_ComponentLOD.png)

#### Component Material Overrides

You can set a Material Override for selected components, which means that an individual component can have a different Material assigned to it than its Landscape does.

**To set a Material Override for selected components:**

1. Select the components that you want to use a different Material for. For information about selecting components, see [Selection](#Selection).

1. In the **Content Browser**, find and select the Material you want to use.

1. In the Level Editor's **Details** panel, under **Landscape Component**, click the Assign arrow icon (![Assign](Shared\Icons\icon_assign_left_16x.png)) to assign that Material to the selected components.
