The **Procedural Foliage Blocking Volume** is a Volume Actor that can be placed in a level and scaled to a desired size which will prevent the Procedural Foliage Spawner 
from spawning any Foliage Actors inside of the bounds of the Procedural Foliage Blocking Volume.
In the following section we will go over how you can add a **Procedural Foliage Blocking Volume** to your level and use it to prevent Foliage meshes from spawning.
We will be continuing to work with the **PFT_00** level that was used in the last step.

1. First find the **Procedural Foliage Blocking Volume** by searching for it in the **Modes** panel using **Proc** as the search term.

1. Select the Procedural Foliage Blocking Volume and then drag it from the Modes panel into the level.

1. To stop foliage meshes from being spawned in the back portion of the Procedural Foliage Spawner move and scale the Procedural Foliage Blocking Volume using the following location and scale values.

	* **Location X:** 5430.0 cm
	* **Location Y:** -3900.0 cm
	* **Location Z:** 200.0 cm
	* **Scale    X:** 41.75
	* **Scale    Y:** 65.5
	* **Scale    X:** 41.75

1. Now select the **Procedural Foliage Spawner** in the level and then in the **Details** click on the **Resimulate** button.
   When the Resimulate is completed you should now be missing the entire back section of trees that where intersecting with the Procedural Foliage Blocking Volume.

	In the following image we can see the before and after results. 

	|Image Number| Results|
