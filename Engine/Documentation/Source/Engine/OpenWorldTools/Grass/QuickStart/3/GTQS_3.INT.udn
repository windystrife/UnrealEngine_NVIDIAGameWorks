%Steps%

Before we can begin to use the Grass Tools we first have to create Material that can work with both the Landscape terrain and the **Landscape Grass Type**. 
In the following section we will cover how to set up this Material as well as how to link it so that it will work with the Landscape Grass Type.

If you would like to have a more in-depth look at how the Landscape terrain works in UE4 check out the [Landscape](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Landscape/index.html) pages for more information.

1. First create a new Material for our Landscape Terrain by **right - clicking** in the **Content Browser** then selecting the **Material** option form the **Create Basic Asset** 
  section naming the new Material **MAT_GT_Grass**

1. Open up the **MAT_GT_Grass** Material by **double - clicking** on the Material inside of the **Content Browser** and then add the following two Textures from the **Open World Demo Collection** to the Material Graph.

	* **T_AlpinePatch001_D_alt_R**
	* **T_GDC_Grass01_D_NoisyAlpha**

1. Search for the Material Expression nodes listed below using the **Palette** search function.
	Once you locate a required Material Expression node select it in the Palette and then dragging it into the Material Graph.

	|Material Expression Name | Amount | The Why|
	|-------------------------|--------|--------|
	|**Landscape Layer Blend**   | 1     | To make the Landscape terrain look more realistic you will often need to blend and paint multiple together or separately and that is what the Landscape Layer Blend allows you to do. |
	|**Landscape Layer Sample**  | 1     | This Material Expression allows the Material and the Landscape to talk to one another to ensure the right Static Mesh is used whenever a certain Landscape layer is painted . |
	|**Landscape Grass Output**  | 1     | This enables the Landscape terrain to be able to spawn the Grass Types based on the setup in the Landscape Material. |

1. Select the **Landscape Layer Blend** node and under the **Details** panel in the **Layers** section and add two new Layers to it by clicking the **Plus** icon 2 times.

1. Once 2 layers have been added, set the **Layer Name** of one to **Grass** and set the **Layer Name** of the other one to **Rock** also setting the **Preview Weight** to **1.0** for each.

1. Connect the **T_AlpinePatch001_D_alt_R** Texture to the **Layer Rock** input on the **Landscape Layer Blend** node then connect the **T_GDC_Grass01_D_NoisyAlpha** to the **Layer Grass** input finally connect the **Output** of the **Landscape Layer Blend** node into the **Base Color** input on the **Main Material Node**.

1. Select the **Landscape Grass Output** node in the Material Graph then in the **Details** panel in the **Grass Types** section press the **Plus** sign icon to add a new element to the Grass Types array.

1. In the **Content Browser**, select the **Grass_00** Landscape Grass Type that was created in the last step.

1.  In the **Material** under the **Grass Type** option, press the **Arrow** icon to load the Actor that is currently selected in the Content Browser.

1. Select the **Landscape Layer Sample** node under the **Parameter Name** input **Grass** for the name and connect the Output from the **Landscape Layer Sample** to the input of the **Landscape Grass Output** node.

1. When completed you should have a Material that looks like the following. As always, do not forget to press the **Apply** and **Save** buttons to compile and save the Material.
