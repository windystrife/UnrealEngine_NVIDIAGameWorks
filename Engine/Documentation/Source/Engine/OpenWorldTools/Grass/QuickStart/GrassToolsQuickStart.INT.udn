SkillLevel:Intermediate
Version: 4.8

## Overview

In this Quick Start tutorial we will take a look at how you can setup and use the new **GrassTool** that are now available with the 4.8 release of Unreal Engine 4 (UE4).
Over the course of this Quick Start tutorial you will learn how to create, setup, and spawn static meshes to make your Landscape look like it is densely covered in thick grass. 
You will also be introduced to key properties and settings that will help you shape your virtual grasslands to fit your project's needs.

You will also be exposed to all of the required Actors and properties the Grass tool requires to function correctly and deliver the results you want.
When you have completed this Quick Start you will have a new level that should look similar to the image above. 

[region:note]
Currently the Grass system will only work with the Landscape Terrain Actor. Trying to use the Grass system to spawn grass on any other Actor type will not work.
