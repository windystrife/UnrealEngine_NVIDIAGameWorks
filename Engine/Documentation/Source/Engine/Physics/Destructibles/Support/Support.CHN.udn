## Overview

**Destructible Actors** in Unreal Engine 4 will shatter completely with the first amount of damage able to cause a fracture, unless some measure of support is defined. Support will make **Destructibles** behave more like real objects.

_These are the primary settings to examine for support._

## Support Layer

This is the base level of support, and it is just a single value on the **Destructible** that points to a layer level. This layer will then act as support for the rest of the object, making it so the pieces that have not taken damage stick together.

Think of a slab of concrete hitting the ground on one of its corners, without support, it just shatters:

But with a support layer set to a layer other than 0, this happens:

![](DS_support.png)(w:500)

For APEX PhysX Lab imported objects, it is possible to have more than 2 depth layers, making it so you can set a mid layer as support making everything "above" it stick together, but everything "below" it just fall apart.

<!--
## Support Chunks

This will basically work like the **Support Layer** feature, but instead of making an entire level support, you can make individual chunks on a layer support. There doesn't _need_ to be any rhyme or reason to what bits you define as support, but it could create some rather interesting results. Another way to look at them is that support chunks are sticky, and more damage is needed for them to give up what they are attached to.

## World Support

**World Support** allows a destructible to "attach" itself to a Static Mesh in the world. The destructible just needs to be really close to the Static Object you want to support it. To be safe, you can just have the destructible penetrate the Static Object, but too much penetration does open the asset up to having chunks rapidly expel themselves from the Static Mesh if they are ever dealt enough damage to break off.

## Forming Extended Structures



<!--
As for objects imported from APEX PhysX Lab, these objects allow for an extreme amount of chaining, but are still bound by the order in which they are placed.

In this image, the radial force (the little icon in the middle) ticks every 2 seconds, applying damage and force to all the panels.

They were placed from right to left so on the first pulse:

![](DS_ApexOrder_01.png)(convert:false)

Second Pulse

![](DS_ApexOrder_02.png)(convert:false)

Third Pulse:

![](DS_ApexOrder_03.png)(convert:false)

And finally:

![](DS_ApexOrder_04.png)(convert:false)

Mind you, this is just for **World Supported** APEX objects. If they had been "free" then on the 2nd pulse this happens:

![](DS_2ndPulseNoWorldSupport.png)

The 2nd and 4th panels "shatter" while the center one is just "broken."
