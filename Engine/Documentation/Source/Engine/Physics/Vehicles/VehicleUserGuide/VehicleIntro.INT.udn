At the end of this guide, you'll have a fully functional vehicle that you can use in your own game projects.

## Goal

In this guide, we'll cover the creation of a vehicle using the **Wheeled Vehicle** Blueprint class in a new blank project. This guide will take you through the process of creating all the necessary
in-editor items you need to have a functional vehicle but assumes you have your own **Skeletal Mesh** and a **Physics Asset** ready to go. At the end of this guide, you should have a fully functional
vehicle similar to the one from the Vehicle Game or the Vehicle Template.

[REGION:note]
If you need information on getting a vehicle Skeletal Mesh and a Physics Asset into the engine, please see the [Vehicle Content Guide](Engine/Physics/Vehicles/VehcileContentCreation).
Alternatively, you can work out of the **Vehicle Template** or the **Vehicle Game** project to have access to a pre-built Skeletal Mesh and Physics Asset.
The **Vehicle Template** is in the **New Project** menu of the **Unreal Project Browser**, and the **Vehicle Game** is on the **Learn** tab of the **Epic Games Launcher**.

## Objective

During the course of this tutorial you will create the key components that make up a Vehicle in Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). Some of this requires assets that you create outside of UE4, while the majority
of the components will be created right inside of the Editor!

This is the individual assets that make up the Vehicle we'll construct: 

* A Skeletal Mesh
* A Physics Asset
* An Animation Blueprint
* A Vehicle Blueprint
* One or more Wheel Blueprints.
* A TireConfig Data Asset

By the end of this guide you'll know how to setup each of these asset types and how they work together to bring your vehicles to life!

* How to configure a TireConfig Data Asset
* How to configure a Wheel Blueprint for your Font and Rear wheels.
* How to setup an Animation Blueprint specifically for a Vehicle.
* How to configure your Vehicle Blueprint with your Skeletal Mesh, Animation Blueprint, and Wheel Blueprint(s).
* How to configure your Axis Mappings and Bindings to control your Vehicle.
* How to create and assign a new Game Mode to spawn your vehicle.
