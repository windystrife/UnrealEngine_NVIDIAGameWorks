In this first step to creating our own vehicle, we have two parts that go together to make up the wheels for the vehicle; the TireConfig Data Asset and the Wheel Blueprint class. We'll start by first
creating the TireConfig Data Asset and then move on to create the Wheel Blueprint that houses properties for our wheels, including where the TireConfig data is assigned to.

Follow along with the steps below to get started creating your TireConfig data and then using that with a Wheel Blueprint.

## Tire Config Data Asset

The **TireConfig Data Asset** is used to control **Friction Scale**. This value not only affects the raw friction of the wheel but also scales the values for how difficult (or easy) it is for the
wheel to slide while in a hard turn. There is also the additional option of **Tire Friction Scales**, which enables you to specify a specific Friction Scale to different Physical Material types.

### Create your TireConfig Data Asset

1. In the **Content Browser**, click the **Add New** Button, then hover over **Miscellaneous** and then select **Data Asset** from the Context Menu. 
1. In the **Pick Data Asset Class** window, select **TireConfg** to create this type of Data Asset. 
1. The new asset will be created in your **Content Browser**. Make sure to give it a recognizable name so you can easily locate it later.

[REGION:warning]
In the Pick Data Asset Class window, you may notice that there is also a **TireType** Data Asset class. This is a deprecated function and is only used when upgrading older projects to Unreal Engine, version 4.15 (or a later version).
You should not have any reason to use this data asset type if using Unreal Engine, version 4.15 (or later).

## Wheel Blueprints 

In most cases, you will have at least two wheel types; a wheel that is affected by steering and one that is not. Also, this may be the case for having differently sized wheels for the front or the back, in
which case, you have full control over setting the differing radii, mass, width, handbrake effect, suspension, and many other properties to give your vehicle the handling you desire.

### Create your Wheel Blueprint

1. In the **Content Browser**, click the **Add New** button, then select **Blueprint Class** from the menu. 
1. In the **Pick Parent Class** window, under **All Classes**, search for "wheel" and then select **VehicleWheel**.
1. The new asset will be created in your **Content Browser**. Make sure to give it a recognizable name so that you can easily locate it later. 
1. **Optional** - Repeat these steps again so that you have a **front** and **rear** wheel type.

### Editing the Wheel Blueprint

Now that you've got your Wheel Blueprint(s), open them in the Blueprint Editor, where you'll see all the available options to edit your wheels!

There are five properties that we need to initially change for each wheel, as the rest of them will change how the vehicle performs (and should be tweaked later) as you start to test out the vehicle in your
own game. 

* **Shape Radius**
* **Shape Width**
* **Affected by Handbrake (usually restricted to the rear wheels)**
* **Steer Angle (usually only the front wheels)**

[REGION:note]
The properties here are set to match the Buggy from Vehicle Game. If you're using your own Skeletal Mesh, you may need to use different values for the **Shape Radius** and **Shape Width**.
[/REGION]

Now, under the **Tire** section, you can assign the Tire Config Data Asset that you initially created using the **Tire Config** selection box.

## End Result

At this point, you've set up your Tire Config Data Asset, which is used to control how much the tires slide on any surface, having set up the Wheel Blueprint that can be used to specify all of the different 
properties for your wheel. In the next step, you'll continue creating the assets you need, which make up our vehicle ,by creating the Animation Blueprint that handles all of the necessary animation information
for our vehicle (such as spinning tires, steering, suspension, etc).
