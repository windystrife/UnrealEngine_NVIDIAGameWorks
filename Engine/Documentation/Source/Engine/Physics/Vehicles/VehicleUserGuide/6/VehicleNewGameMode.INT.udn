In the previous step, you finished setting up our Vehicle Blueprint and assigned all of the controls that you need to make it work properly. In this last step, you'll finish by setting up a new Game Mode that uses your own Vehicle Blueprint as the Default Pawn for the game. 

[REGION:note]
If you did not use a Blank Project Template when starting this guide you may find that you already have a Game Mode assigned that conflicts with the one you'll create in this step. Use the steps below to create a new Game Mode so that you can spawn in the vehicle you've created throughout this guide.
