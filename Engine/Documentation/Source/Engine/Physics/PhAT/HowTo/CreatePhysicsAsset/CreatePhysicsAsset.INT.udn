There are two ways to create a new **Physics Asset**: on import or by using the context menu in the **Content Browser**. Below are the steps and interfaces for both methods.

## Steps

When a Skeletal Mesh is imported, there is an option to generate a Physics Asset for it as it is imported. Once the imported file is processed, you will be presented with the 
"New Asset" dialog:

However, you can follow these steps if you need to create a Physics Asset for a Skeletal Mesh at a later time:

1. Find the Skeletal Mesh asset you wish to add a Physics Asset to in the 
**Content Browser**.
1. **Right-click** on the Skeletal Mesh in the Content Browser to bring up the **Context Menu** -> **Create** -> **Create Physics Asset**.
1. Adjust setting to your liking.

1. **Click** 'Ok'.

## Result

Upon creating a **Physics Asset** you will find it in the same folder as the **Skeletal Mesh** it is based on.
