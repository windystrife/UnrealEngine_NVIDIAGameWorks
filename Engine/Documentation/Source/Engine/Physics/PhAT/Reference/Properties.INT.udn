This page contains a reference listing of properties for Physics Asset Tool, separated into 3 expandable sections based on what is selected in the viewport.

## Physics Asset Tool Properties

When no Physics Body or Physics Constraint is selected (regardless of mode), the properties for the Physics Asset Tool are show in the Details panel.

### Anim

### Simulation

### Drawing

[REGION:raw]
| Property | Description |
| --- | :--- |
| **Constraint Draw Size** | Controls how large constraints are drawn in the **Physics Asset Tool**. |

<!--
[EXCERPT:UpdateJointsfromAnimationEnum]

Determines whether simulation of root body updates component transform.

| Value | Description |
| --- | :--- |
| **Simulation Updates Component Transfrom** | Simulation updates the component's transform. |
| **Component Trasform is Kinematic** | Simulation doesn't update the component's transform. Instead it is driven by animation, blueprint, etc... |
[/EXCERPT]

## Body Mode Properties

When the Physics Asset Tool is in Body Mode and a Physics Body is selected, the Details panel will display the properties for that Physics Body.

### Physics

![](PhATBody2.png)

[REGION:raw]
| Property | Description |
| --- | :--- |
| **Mass in KG** | Mass of the body in KG. |
| **Linear Damping** | "Drag" force added to reduce linear movement. |
| **Angular Damping** | "Drag" force added to reduce angular movement.  |
| **Enable Gravity** | If object should have the force of gravity applied.  |
| **Physics Type** | If this is set to **Simulated** it will use physics. If this is set to **Kinematic** it will use kinematic. **Default** will inherit from **OwnerComponent**'s behavior. |
| **Double Sided Geometry** | If true, the physics triangle mesh will use double sided faces when doing scene queries. Thsi is useful for planes and single sided meshes that need traces to work on both sides. |
| **Simple Collision Physical Material** | The **Physical Material** to use for simple collision on this body. |
[/REGION]

#### Advanced

[REGION:raw]
| Property | Description |
| --- | :--- |
| **Start Awake** | If the physics body should start awake (and moving), or asleep (stationary until interacted with). |
| **Center of Mass Offset** | User specified offset for the center of mass of this object, from the calculated location. |
| **Mass Scale** | Per-instance scaling of mass. |
| **Max Angular Velocity** | The maximum angular velocity for this instance. |
| **Generate Wake Events** | Should **wake**/**sleep** events fire when this object is woken up or put to sleep by the physics simulation. |
| **Max Depenetration Velocity** | The maximum velocity used to depenetrate this object.  |
| **Walkable Slope Override** | Custom walkable slope setting for this body. See the [Walkable Slope](Engine/Physics/WalkableSlope) documentation for usage information. |
| **Walkable Slope Behavior** | Behavior of this surface (whether we affect the walkable slope). Determines how the Walkable Slope Angle operates on the existing walkable angle, whether it increases or decreases it. |
| **Walkable Slope Angle** | Override walkable slope, applying the rules of the Walkable Slope Behavior. |
| **Custom Sleep Threshold Multiplier** | If the **SleepFamily** is set to custom, multiply the natural sleep threshold by this amount. A higher number will cause the body to sleep sooner. |
| **Position Solver Iteration Count** | This physics body's solver iteration count for position. Increasing this will be more CPU intensive, but better stabilized. |
| **Velocity Solver Iteration Count** | This physics body's solver iteration count for velocity. Increasing this will be more CPU intensive, but better stabilized. |
| **Sleep Family** | The set of values used in considering when put this body to sleep. |
