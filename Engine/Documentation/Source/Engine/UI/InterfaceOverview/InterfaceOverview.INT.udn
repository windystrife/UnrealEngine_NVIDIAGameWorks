The **Unreal Editor** is a suite of editors, browsers, and tools for working with content in the Unreal Engine. At the core, 
it is used for level design; but contained within are editors and browsers for importing and manipulating content 
for your game project.


## Interface Element Types

[EXCERPT:Intro]
The interface of Unreal Editor is completely configurable in terms of layout. It is comprised of tabbed windows that can 
be rearranged to suit your needs. These windows can either be top-level editors or tabs within those editors.
[/EXCERPT:Intro]

### Editors

**Editors** are like applications within the Unreal Editor, such as the [**Level Editor**](Engine/UI/LevelEditor) and [**Blueprint Editor**](Engine/Blueprints/Editor). 
They are targeted at a specific aspect of the development process. Some editors, such as the Level Editor, can only have 
a single instance in existence at any time; while other editors, like the Blueprint editor, can have multiple instances created, 
but only a single instance can be editing a specific asset at any time. 

General editors are opened through the **Window** menu, while asset editors are opened by choosing to edit a particular 
type of asset. The **Level Editor** is a special case and is always present while Unreal Editor is open.

Editors can be closed by clicking the ![Close App Button](button_close_app.png) button on the editor's tab or by **right-
clicking** and choose **Close**.

Each editor consists of a Menu Bar and one or more Tabs which comprise the majority of the functionality of the editor.


### Editor Tabs

If you are using multiple editors simultaneously, it may help save screen space to dock them together. At the top of every editor is a beveled tab containing the name of the editor and the asset being edited. By dragging that tab, you can dock that editor alongside any other editor in the view.

[REGION:note]
Editor tabs differ from the tabs used on Panels. Panels can be docked anywhere within their native editor. Editor tabs can only be docked alongside other editors. Also note the difference in shape; editor tabs are beveled in at the sides, where panel tabs remain squared.
[/REGION]


### Panels

**Panels** are specialized parts of editors that provide a specific aspect of the functionality of the editor. Editors can 
contain any number of panels. The panels belonging to a specific editor only affect their parent editor and can only be docked 
within that particular editor. 

Panels are opened through the **Window** menu as well.

Most panels will have tabs at their upper left corner. These tabs can be used to reposition, re-dock, or close the panel. Panels can be closed by **right-clicking** on the tab and choosing **Close** or clicking the small **X** on the right side of the tab.

[REGION:note]
	Whenever possible, tabs will be named after the asset currently being edited within that tab's editor. For instance, the Level Editor tab will display the name of the level currently being edited.
[/REGION]

If a tab is the only one within a tab well, it can be hidden by **right-clicking** on it and choosing **Hide Tabs** 
or through the **Hide Tabs** option in the Tab Options menu. This simply collapses the tab well so that only the content 
portion of the tab is displayed. When a tab is hidden, the top-left corner becomes gold.

Clicking the top-left corner will expand the tab again.


### Menus

Menus will be located at the top of any appropriate editor window. Some of the menus, such as **Window** and **Help**, are consistent throughout all editor windows.

### Docking and Layout

Tabs can be docked simply by dragging the tab from its current location to where it is to be docked.

The layout of tabs in the editor, including floating windows, is persistent between sessions and is saved automatically when 
closing the editor. Tabs also remember their last location and will reopen there.
