[EXCERPT:Intro]
The **Property Matrix** allows for easy bulk editing and value comparison for large numbers of Objects 
or Actors. It displays a configurable set of properties for a collection of objects as columns in a 
table view that can be sorted on any column. The Property Matrix also provides a standard 
property editor that displays all properties for the current selection set in the table view.

## Features

| Feature | Benefits |
| ------- | -------- |
| Bulk Object Editing | [INCLUDE:#BulkEditing] |
| Bulk Fine-Grain Object Comparison  | [INCLUDE:#BulkComparison] |
| Deep Property and Array Support  | [INCLUDE:#PropertySupport] |

<!--
[EXCERPT:BulkEditing]

* Easier workflow for setting a series of varying values to a bunch of objects, without sacrificing 
the ability to set the property on a bunch of objects to the same value.
* Works with THOUSANDS of objects at the same time.
* Can handle editing a wide variety of object types at the same time.

[/EXCERPT:BulkEditing]
[EXCERPT:BulkComparison]

* Sort the values on thousands of objects at a time.
* Quickly find assets and Actors with incorrect settings.

[/EXCERPT:BulkComparison]
[EXCERPT:PropertySupport]

* Do all of the above with the properties of Arrays and Struct types.
* Can expose columns for ANY PROPERTY.
* Even handles ARRAY INDICES.

## Accessing the Property Matrix

There are currently two ways you can access the **Property Matrix**:

* The ![Property Matrix](button_property_matrix.png) button available in the **Details** panel adjacent to 
the **Search** box will launch a **Property Matrix** bound with your current selection. 

	![](open_matrix_details.png)

* In the [](Engine/Content/Browser), make a selection of assets, **right-click**, choose **Asset Actions**, then choose **Bulk Edit via Property Matrix**. 
from the context menu.

## Using the Property Matrix

The Property Matrix is effectively a table and handles much like other grid-based editors. All cells have 
two modes _Display_ and _Edit_. Depending on  the current mode the cells feature set changes. 

### Adding and Removing Columns

The user can add and remove columns by pinning and unpinning properties in the property tree to the right 
of the table.

[REGION:imagetable]
| ![](columns_pin_message.png) | ![](columns_pin.png) |
| ------ | ------ |
| No properties pinned | Pin properties to add columns |
[/REGION]

Columns can also be removed through the drop down menus in column headers or by **middle-clicking** the column 
header itself.

The Property Matrix will attempt to auto-populate the table with useful columns, based on the types of objects 
bound to the table.

### Editing Properties

Most cells just display their bound value as text and allow the user to edit the text representation, but 
cells are fully customizable by the programmer and can vary greatly. For example, some cells have completely custom cell implementation such as Boolean and Color values.

[REGION:imagetable]
| ![](property_edit_bool.png) | ![](property_edit_color.png) |
| ------ | ------ |
| Bool | Color |
[/REGION]

One great feature of the Property Matrix is that it lets you compare property values deep in an object.

[REGION:imagetable]
| ![](subprop_pin.png) | ![](subprop_display.png) |
| ------ | ------ |
| Pinned deeply nested property | Deeply nested property neatly displayed |
[/REGION]

The property table can even handle array indices!!

![](subprop_array_index.png)

The Property Tree on the right of the table is bound to the selected rows in the table. This allows the 
Property Matrix to handle editing a wide variety of types at the same time!

### Sorting

The user can also sort any column in ascending or descending order by simply clicking on the column header. 
An arrow will appear on the header to let you know which way the column is sorted.

| **End** or **Ctrl + Right Arrow** | Moves the current cell to the last cell in the row. |
| **Ctrl + Home** | Moves the current cell to the first cell in the table. |
| **Ctrl + End** | Moves the current cell to the last cell in the table. |
