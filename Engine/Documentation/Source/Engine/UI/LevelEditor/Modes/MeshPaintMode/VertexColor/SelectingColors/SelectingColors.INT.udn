Description:An overiview of the process of color selection for Mesh Paint Mode.
Version: 4.9


[EXCERPT:Intro]
The Mesh Paint tool relies on a pair of colors for its work. Users may choose a _Paint Color_ as well as an _Erase Color_ and swap between them at any time. Color selections are made by way of a standard  [Color Picker window](Engine/UI/ColorPicker).

For workflow purposes, it will be easier to think of the _Erase Color_ as simply an alternate paint color. Using the erase color is not like removing your previous strokes, as it would be while using the Erase Tool in Photoshop or a similar image editing software. Rather, you are just painting on a different color. If your base was white, then it would be a good idea to use white as your erase color.

While in the **Mesh Paint Mode** panel, you can also hit the Swap Button ![](button_swap.png) to swap the Paint and Erase colors. This is especially handy when you need to quickly jump back and forth between a pair of colors, or do a fast touch-up on a misplaced brush stroke.

[REGION:tip]
	Keep in mind that the Color Picker has a variety of means to aid in the quick selection of colors, including saving color swatches and setting up color themes. Please see the [Color Picker documentation](Engine/UI/ColorPicker) for details.
