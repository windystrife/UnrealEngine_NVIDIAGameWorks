[EXCERPT:Intro]
The **Level Editor** provides the core level creation functionality for Unreal Editor. This is where levels are created, viewed, and modified mainly by placing, transforming, and editing the properties of [**Actors**](Engine/Actors).
[/EXCERPT:Intro]

[EXCERPT:Levels]
In Unreal Editor, the scenes in which you create your game experience are generally referred to as [Levels](Engine/Levels). You can think of a level as a 3D environment into which you place a series of objects and geometry to define the world your players will experience. Any object that is placed in your world, be it a light, a mesh, or a character, is considered to be an Actor. Technically speaking, _Actor_ is a programming class used within the Unreal Engine to define an object that has 3D position, rotation, and scale data. For sake of ease, however, it will be easiest to think of an Actor as _any object that can be placed in your levels_.
[/EXCERPT:Levels]

[EXCERPT:Actors]
At its most basic level, creating levels boils down to placing items in a map inside Unreal Editor. These items may be world geometry, decorations in the form of Brushes, Static Meshes, lights, player starts, weapons, or vehicles. Which items are added when is usually defined by the particular workflow used by the level design team.

## The Default Interface

Since the interface for Unreal Editor is highly customizable, it is possible that what you see may change from one launch to the next. Below, you can see the default interface layout:

### Tab Bar

The Level Editor has a tab along the top providing the name of the level currently being edited. Tabs from other editor windows may be docked alongside this tab for quick and easy navigation, similar to a web browser.

The name of the tab itself will reflect the level currently being edited. This is a pattern consistent throughout the editor - editor tabs will be named after the current asset being edited.

To the right of the Tab Bar is the name of the current project.

See the [**Menu Bar**](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/MenuBar) page for descriptions of each menu and its contents.

The **Console** (`) is a text field that allows special console commands to be entered that are recognized by the editor. The text field has an auto-complete feature that automatically lists all commands matching the text currently in the box.

The button on the far right of the menu bar is:

|Button|Name|Description|
|---|---|---|
|[INCLUDE:#SourceControlButtons] | **Source Control Status** | This tells whether you are connected to source control. You can mouse over for connection details, and click to set up a connection. Perforce and Subversion are supported. See [Source Control documentation](Engine/UI/SourceControl) for details.|

<!--

### Toolbar

![Toolbar Panel](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Toolbar/toolbar.png)(w:720)

The **Toolbar** panel, like in most applications, is a group of commands providing quick access to commonly used tools and operations.

See the [**Toolbar**](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Toolbar) page for descriptions of each of the items on the Toolbar.

### Viewport

The **Viewport** panel is your window into the worlds you create in UnrealEd. 

![Viewport Panel](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Viewports/viewports_LE.png)(w:720)

This panel contains a set of viewports, each of which can be maximized to fill the entire panel and offer the ability to display the world from one of three orthographic views (Top, Side, Front) or a perspective view giving you complete control over what you see as well as how you see it.

See [**Viewports**](Engine/UI/LevelEditor\Viewports) for more information on working with viewports.

### Details

![Details Panel](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Details/details_panel.png)

The **Details** panel contains information, utilities, and functions specific to the current selection in the viewport. It contains transform edit boxes for moving, rotating, and scaling Actors, displays all of the editable properties for the selected Actors, and provides quick access to additional editing functionality depending on the type of Actor(s) selected in the viewport. For instance, selected Actors can be exported to FBX and converted to another compatible type. The Selection Details also allows you to view the materials used by the selected Actors, if any, and quickly open them for editing.

See the [**Details**](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Details) page for a more complete overview and guide to using the **Details** panel in the Level Editor.

### Modes

[INCLUDE:Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Modes#main]

### World Outliner

[REGION:raw]
![Scene Outliner Panel](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/SceneOutliner/scene_outliner.png)
[/REGION]


The **World Outliner** panel displays all of the Actors within the scene in a hierarchical tree view. Actors can be selected and modified directly from the **World Outliner**. You can also use the Info drop down menu to turn on an extra column that shows Levels, Layers, or ID Names.

See the [**World Outliner**](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/SceneOutliner) page for details on using the **World Outliner**.

### Layers

[INCLUDE:Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Layers#Overview]

See the **[](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Layers)** page for details on using the **Layers** panel.
