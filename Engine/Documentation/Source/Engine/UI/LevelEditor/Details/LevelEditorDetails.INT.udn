[TOC(start:2 end:3)]

[EXCERPT:DetailsOverview]
The **Details** panel contains information, utilities, and functions specific to the current selection in the viewport. 
It contains transform edit boxes for moving, rotating, and scaling Actors, displays all of the editable properties for 
the selected Actors, and provides quick access to additional editing functionality depending on the types of Actors selected 
in the viewport. For instance, selected Actors can be exported to FBX and converted to another compatible type. The Details 
panel also allows you to view the Materials used by the selected Actors, if any, and quickly open them for editing.

For more information about the Details Panel UI, see **[](Engine/UI/LevelEditor\Details\Interface)**.

## Actor Names

Actors can have _friendly_ names set directly in the editor by the designer. These names can be used to access these Actors or 
find them using the search functionality in the **[World Outliner panel](Engine/UI/LevelEditor\SceneOutliner)**.

To edit the Actor Name, simply type the name into the text box in at the top of the **Details** panel.

## Search Filter

The properties displayed within the Details panel can be filtered using the **Search** box. As you type, the properties are 
automatically filtered to display only those properties matching the text.

![Properties filtered](LE_DetailsSearch2.png)

To clear the filter, click the ![Clear Search](button_clear_search.png) button to the right of the **Search** box.

[REGION:tip]
Because this line hides away any details that do not match the search criteria, check to make sure it is cleared if you do not 
see the property you are looking for.

## Favorites

[REGION:warning]
This option is currently considered experimental and some features may not work as expected. 
[/REGION]

If there are properties within an Actor that you frequently change or want quick access to, you can use the property **Favorites** to flag them so they appear at the top of the **Details** panel.

[REGION:note]
Some properties may not offer the ability to favorite them, due to the complexity of their customization.

## Default Values

When a property is modified to a value other than its _default_ value, an indicator is displayed.

![Property not set to default](default_indicator.png)

All properties can easily be reset to their default values by clicking the ![Reset to Default](button_reset_default.png) indicator 
and choosing to reset the value from the menu.

![Reset to Default Menu](reset_default_menu.png)

The value of the property is reset to the default value as shown in the menu and the indicator is no longer present.

## Edit Conditions

Properties can be either be enabled or disabled. A property can only be edited when it is enabled. By default, 
all properties are enabled unless they have an edit condition. Properties with an edit condition, rely on 
the value of another variable to determine whether they are enabled and can be edited or not. 

In some cases, edit conditions are used to determine whether the property will override some other value or whether it has any 
affect at all. Other times, certain properties may simply not make sense unless some condition is met. For example, you may have 
a group of properties that pertain to indirect lighting and a `bool` property that globally toggles whether indirect lighting is 
enabled or disabled. Each property in the group could be conditional on the global toggle so they are only enabled when indirect 
lighting is being used.

A property with a simple edit condition will be displayed with a checkbox in the left margin. When the checkbox is toggled on, 
the property is enabled. When not checked, the property is disabled and grayed out.

## EditConst Properties

Properties declared as `editconst`, which cannot be modified in the editor, display their values and are highlighted to indicate they cannot be edited.

## Property Controls

Many of the basic types of properties are displayed in the Details panel using familiar editing widgets. 
Other types use customized widgets to provide a more intuitive experience when modifying their values.

## Categories

Properties in the **Display** panel are displayed in _categories_. Generally, these categories - **Rendering**, 
**Lighting**, **Collision**, etc. - are determined by how the property is declared in code, and are used as a 
means of organizing related properties into groups. Other categories you see in the Details panel - **Transform**, 
**Static Mesh**, **Materials**, **Actor**, **Code View**, **Layers** - are custom widgets designed to expose certain 
properties or functionality in a conspicuous manner making them easy to find and modify or use.

### Advanced Properties

Some properties are declared as advanced and are hidden away by default in the Details panel. Categories that 
contain advanced properties have an expander button ![](button_advanced.png). Clicking the button causes the advanced 
properties to be displayed.
