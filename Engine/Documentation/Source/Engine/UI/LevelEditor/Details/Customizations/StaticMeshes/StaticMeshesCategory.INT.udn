Title: Static Meshes Category
Crumbs: %ROOT%, Engine, Engine/UI, Engine/UI/LevelEditor, Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Details
Description:Customized controls for viewing and modifying the StaticMesh assets applied to all components of an Actor.
Version: 4.9

The **Static Mesh** category in the **Details** panel is only displayed when the selected Actor(s) are StaticMeshActors 
or InterpActors. It promotes the normally buried StaticMesh property of the Actor's StaticMeshComponent, making it a 
first-class citizen and displays it using a customized widget that includes a thumbnail along with the usual 
[**Object reference**](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Details/Properties/ObjectReference) property controls.

In addition, when a StaticmeshActor is selected, the category contains _advanced controls_ that can be exposed by clicking the ![](button_advanced_controls.png) button.

For generating BlockingVolumes 
using various preset methods.

| Control | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| ![](button_blocking_volume.png) | Generates a _BlockingVolume_ from the _StaticMesh_ to use as collision using one of the following methods: [INCLUDE:#BlockingVolume] |

[EXCERPT:BlockingVolume]
[REGION:simpletable]
| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| *Blocking Volume* | Creates a BlockingVolume in the shape of a cube with the dimensions of the StaticMesh's bounding box. |
| *Heavy Convex Volume* | Creates a convex BlockingVolume from the StaticMesh's geometry with a **NormalTolerance** of 0.01. |
| *Normal Convex Volume* | Creates a convex BlockingVolume from the StaticMesh's geometry with a **NormalTolerance** of 0.15. |
| *Light Convex Volume* | Creates a convex BlockingVolume from the StaticMesh's geometry with a **NormalTolerance** of 0.50. |
| *Rough Convex Volume* | Creates a convex BlockingVolume from the StaticMesh's geometry with a **NormalTolerance** of 0.75. |

[REGION:note]
$ NormalTolerance : The rejection tolerance.  When figuring out which planes to cut the blocking volume cube with
the code will reject any planes that are less than "NormalTolerance" different in their normals.
This cuts down on the number of planes that will be used for generating the cutting planes and,
as a side effect, eliminates duplicates.
