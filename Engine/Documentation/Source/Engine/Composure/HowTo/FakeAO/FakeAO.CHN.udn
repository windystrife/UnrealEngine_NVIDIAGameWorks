In Order to have the character's feet in the Composure sample look as though they are casting a very soft shadow when the feet come in close contact with a surface, a Fake AO Shadow Blueprint was created. This Blueprint works by adjusting the intensity of a Texture based on how far the character foot is away from a surface. The closer the foot is to the surface the more intense the fake AO shadow will be. The further away the foot is from the surface, the less intense the fake AO shadow will be. In the following How - To we will take a look at setting up the Fake AO Shadow Blueprint.

For this How - To we will be using content that comes with the Composure Sample project. If you have not done so already, make sure to download this content from the Epic Games Launcher.

## Steps

1. Open up the Composure Sample project and from the main toolbar, go to **File** > **New Level** and from the New Level dialogue box, select the **Default** level option.

1. To better see the effect that the  Bp_fake_Ao Blueprint has, search for the **M_gray** Material in the Content Browser and when located, apply it to the **Floor** Static Mesh that is in the level.

## End Result

Now position the camera so that it is looking at the feet of the SK_Mannequin and then press the **Simulate** button and when you look at the  SK_Mannequin feet, they should look like they are casting very faint shadow on the Floor Static Mesh that is under the feet of the  SK_Mannequin like in the following image.
[region:note]
	The only way to see the effect in action is to play or simulate the level the effect is placed in.

[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
	[PARAM:before]
	![No AO Shadow](HTCS_No_Shadow.png)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![AO Shadow](HTCS_Shadow.png)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

[region:note]
	In the above image, dynamic shadows have been disabled to allow of the AO shadow effect to be seen better.
[/region]

With the Player now casting fake soft shadows when their feet come in contact with the floor, you can quickly see how this effect could be used for a wide range of objects to help them cast very cheap yet convincing soft shadows.
