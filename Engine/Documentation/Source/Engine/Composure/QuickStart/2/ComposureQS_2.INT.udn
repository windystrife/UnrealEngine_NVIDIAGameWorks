In the last section, we added the needed assets to help us visualize what is going on and also light the scene. In this section, we will add the needed Actors and Blueprints so that we can start to use Composure.

## Steps

1. From the **Modes** panel, locate the  **Cine Camera Actor** and drag it into the level, position it at 0,0,0 in the world.
