In this part of the Composure Quick Start, we are going be creating and setting up a new Level Sequence that will contain all the needed data to re-make the third shot in the demo sequence.

## Steps

1. From the **Toolbar** click on the **Cinematics** button and from the displayed list, select the **Add Level Sequence** option.

1. Select the **ComposureQS** folder for the location to store the level sequence and name the sequence **shot0030_remake_001**.

1. Once the new Level Sequence has been created, the **Sequencer** editor will open automatically and once it does, immediately set the **Time Snapping Interval** to **24 fps (film)**.

1. Next, click in the Sequencer timeline and while holding down **CRTL** scroll the mouse wheel to zoom the timeline out so you can see more of the timeline.

1.  Click on the **Play** button icon to display the Playback options and then set the **End** to 1591 and the **Start** to 1098.

    [region:note]
    You must set the End frame number first and then the Start frame number in this order to get this to work correctly. Trying this any other way could result in things not working in the desired manner.

1. Press the **Home** key to zoom the Sequencer view to this new frame range and the **Up** arrow key to set the play head to frame 1098.
