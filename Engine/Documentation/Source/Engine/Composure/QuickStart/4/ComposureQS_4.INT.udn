In the last section, we created the needed Level Sequence need for Composure to work. In the following section, we will set this Level Sequence up so that it will work with Composure when played.

## Steps

1. First, in the **Sequencer** tab add a new **Camera Cut** track by pressing the green **+Track** button and selecting **Camera Cut** from the displayed list.

1. Next, add the following Blueprints to Sequencer by selecting them in the World Outliner and then dragging them into Sequencer tracks, just like with the Cine Camera Actor and when completed your Track view should look like the following image:

    * **BP_AdvancedCompositingSkeletalMesh**
    * **BP_AdvancedCompositing Blueprints**

1. In the Track list, under the BP_AdvancedCompositingSkeletalMesh Blueprint press the **Plus** sign next to the **Animation** section and from the displayed list, select the **mocap_patio_walk** animation.

    *    **Location:** -20, -140, 0
    *    **Rotation:** 0, 0, 5

1. Now, we need to add the following Composure specific inputs  by clicking on the **Plus** icon on the right hand side of the BP_AdvancedCompositing Blueprint and selecting the following items from the list:

    *    **Input 0**
    *    **Input 1**
    *    **Distortion Displacement Map**
		[region:note]
		The Distortion Displacement Map track will look empty after adding the image Sequence due to the Image Plate asset having a frame rate of 0. 
		[/region]
    *    **Overscan Sensor Width**
    *    **Overscan Sensor Height**
    *    **Compositing Mode**
    *    **Shadow Color Grading > Gain**

1. With the required Composure tracks now added, make sure that the timeline is set to frame 1098 and then enter the following data by pressing the **Plus** sign next to each track and selecting the data or by inputting a number in the number input:

    *    **Input 0** shot0030_background
    *    **Input 1** shot0030_matte
    *    **Distortion Displacement Map** shot0030_distortion
    *    **Overscan Sensor Width** 37.795
    *    **Overscan Sensor Height** 21.238
    *    **Compositing Mode** Shadow + Occlusion
    *    **Shadow Color Grading > Gain** X: -0.28, Y: -0.35 Z: -0.25

With Sequencer and Composure now setup to be used together, in the next section we will take a look at setting up the needed Game Mode and Level Blueprint Logic that will help all of this work together when the Play or Simulate button is pressed.
