[EXCERPT:Intro]
Unreal Engine 4 contains a four major tools for working with skeletal animations and **Skeletal Meshes**: The Skeleton Editor, the Skeletal Mesh Editor, the Animation Editor, and the Animation Blueprint Editor. Each of these are accessed by editing an associated asset or by using the four navigation buttons at the top of each animation editor.

* The **Skeleton Editor** is for examining and modifying the **Skeleton** of a **Skeletal Mesh**. This is where you'd add **Sockets** to joints or test how your Skeletal Mesh's joints are rotating.

* The **Skeletal Mesh Editor** is where you can import LOD's or assign default materials to your **Skeletal Mesh**. It's also where you'll find ways to attach APEX clothing, modify the Skeletal Mesh's bounds, and even assign a specialized **Shadow Physics Asset**.

* The **Animation Editor** is where you can work with **Animation Sequences** and other animation assets, such as **Blend Spaces** and **Animation Montages**. Here you will create Anim Notifies, work with Pose Assets, adjust compression and timing of Animation Sequences, and build your Animation Montages.

* The final editor is the **Animation Blueprint Editor** where you will create the rules for when and how your animations are played. Here you'll be able to use complex state machines and different blends to bring your characters to life.

[/EXCERPT:Intro]

[REGION:note]
Before Unreal Engine version 4.14, the combined animation editor was known as **Persona**. For 4.14 it was was broken out into four separate editors. While their functionality remains basically the same, some of the interface has changed, and now you can multiple animation editor windows open in different states. For example, you can now have a tab open for each **Animation Sequence** in your game, instead of having a single tab that switches between them (this behavior still remains if you select an **Animation Sequence** in the **Asset Browser**).

Each animation editor can be opened from the **Content Browser** by **Double-clicking** on an asset that is associated with that editor:

| Editor | Asset Types |
| --- | --- |
| Skeleton Editor | Skeleton Asset |
| Skeletal Mesh Editor | Skeletal Mesh |
| Animation Editor | Animation Sequence, Animation Montage, 1D Blend Space, Blend Space, Aim Offset 1D, Aim Offset, Animation Composite, Pose Asset |
| Animation Blueprint Editor | Animation Blueprint |

[REGION:tip]
You can also open an asset's associated editor by **Right-clicking** on any of the above assets in the **Content Browser** and choosing **Edit** from the context menu!

[REGION:caption]
The [Persona Editing Modes](Engine\Animation\Persona\Modes) are represented as buttons on the **Modes** toolbar in the top right corner of the interface. 
[/REGION]

As a vast collection of individual tools, Persona's interface could easily overwhelm if all of its components were visible at all times. To solve this, Persona has been divided into four key modes:

1. Skeleton
1. Mesh
1. Animation
1. Graph

Each mode corresponds to a specific type of task you will want to perform with the tools. Within each mode, only a certain selection of tools and interface elements are visible and available. Keep in mind, however, there is still tremendous room for flexibility, along with some cross-over for performing various tasks without having to switch modes. 


Whether visible or not, all aspects of the interface that can be accessed for each mode are available via Persona's **Window** menu. The full list of panels is below, and each mode's section lists the panels available by default in that mode.

* [Skeleton Tree](Engine/Animation/Persona/SkeletonTree)
* [Asset Browser](Engine/Animation/Persona/AssetBrowser)
* [Viewport](Engine/Animation/Persona/Viewport)
* [Morph Target Previewer](Engine/Animation/Persona/MorphTargetPreviewer)
* [Anim Curves](Engine/Animation/Persona/AnimCurves)
* [Animation Notifies](Engine/Animation/Persona/AnimationNotifies)
* [Retarget Manager](Engine/Animation/Persona\BasePoseManager)
* [Anim Slot Manager](Engine/Animation/AnimMontage#animslotmanager)
* Blend Profiles
* Preview Scene Settings
* [Details](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Details)
* [Anim Asset Details](Engine/Animation/Persona/AnimAssetDetails)
* [Toolbar](Engine/Animation/Persona/Toolbar)



[REGION:note]
The locations below are the default locations for each window. As you move panels around, each interface element may appear in different locations. Be sure to use the tabs for each panel so that you know which panel is which.

[REGION:note]
**Graph** mode will only be available if you have opened an Animation Blueprint from within the **Content Browser**. For all other animation asset types (Skeletons, Animation Sequences, etc.) you will only see Skeleton, Mesh, and Animation. This is due to the fact that you may have multiple Animation Blueprints associated with a single Skeleton and Animation setup.

## Interface Elements

Persona combines a node-based graph editor with other specialized tools and panels that can be used 
for setting up animations for Skeletal meshes. The tools available will update depending on the type of asset being previewed. For instance, if not looking at a BlendSpace, you will not see the BlendSpace Editor.

### Toolbar

![](ToolbarPersona.png)(w:800)

![](ToolbarPersona_BluePrint.png)(w:800)

[INCLUDE:Engine/Animation/Persona/Toolbar#Overview]

See the [](Engine/Animation/Persona/Toolbar) page for details.

### Explorer

[INCLUDE:Engine/Animation/Persona/Explorer#Overview]

See the [](Engine/Animation/Persona/Explorer) page for details.


### My Blueprint

![](MyBlueprint.png)

[INCLUDE:Engine/Blueprints\Editor\MyBlueprint#Intro]

See the [](Engine/Blueprints\Editor/UIComponents\MyBlueprint) page for details.

### Variables

![](Variables.png)

The **Variables** panel allows custom variables to be added to the Animation Blueprint and lists any existing 
variables. Variables will typically either have their values updated within the EventGraph of the Animation 
Blueprint or externally through code. These can then be used in other calculations or as inputs to 
[Blendspaces](Engine/Animation/Blendspaces) to control animation blending.

See the [](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Variables) page for details.

### Details

![Persona: Details Panel](CE_details_panel.png)

The **Details** panel displays properties or a context-sensitive collection of commands and actions that 
act on the current selection in the active graph, such as Blendspace nodes, SkelControls, etc.

See the [](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Details) page for general usage details.

### Debug

![Persona: Debug Panel](CE_debug_panel.png)

The **Debug** panel shows information designated as important by the designer in the form of breakpoints 
and watch values as well as a trace stack of all nodes belonging to the Animation Blueprint that have been executed. 
This window also shows controls for controlling execution of the game when using breakpoints.

See [Debugging](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Debugging) for more information on working with the **Debug** panel to debug Animation Blueprints.

### Asset Browser Panel

[INCLUDE:Engine/Animation/Persona/AssetBrowser#Overview]

See the [](Engine/Animation/Persona/AssetBrowser) page for details.

### Skeleton Tree Panel

![](SkeletonTree.png)

The **Skeleton Tree** panel displays the bone hierarchy of the Skeleton the Animation Blueprint being edited was created from.

See the [Skeleton Tree](Engine/Animation/Persona\SkeletonTree) page for details.

### Viewport Panel

[INCLUDE:Engine/Animation/Persona/Viewport#Overview]

See the [](Engine/Animation/Persona/Viewport) page for details.


### Mesh Details Panel

[INCLUDE:Engine/Animation/Persona\MeshDetails#Overview]

See the [Mesh Details Panel](Engine/Animation/Persona\MeshDetails) page for details.

### Anim Asset Details

[INCLUDE:Engine/Animation/Persona\AnimAssetDetails#Overview]

### Morph Target Previewer

[INCLUDE:Engine/Animation/Persona\MorphTargetPreviewer#Overview]

See the [](Engine/Animation/Persona\MorphTargetPreviewer) page for details.

### Class Defaults (Preview Settings)

![](BlueprintDefaults.png)

When testing out Animation Blueprints, you will often need to adjust the value of certain variables to drive the blends between animations. This is done by way of the Class Defaults panel. Within Persona, the tab for this panel will be hidden by default, and so the window simply reads "Preview Settings."


See the [](Engine/Blueprints\Editor\Modes\Defaults) page for details.

### Graph Panels

![Persona: Graph Panels](CE_graph_panels.png)

[INCLUDE:Engine/Blueprints/Editor/Modes/GraphPanel#Intro]

See the [Blueprint Graph Panel](Engine/Blueprints/Editor/Modes/GraphPanel) section for details.
