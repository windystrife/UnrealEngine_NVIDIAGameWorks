![Animation Notifies Window](AnimationNotifies.png)

The **Anim Notifies** window available inside the **Skeleton Editor** displays all the custom [Animation Notifies](Engine/Animation/Sequences/Notifies) for the currently selected [Skeleton](Engine/Animation/Skeleton) asset. 
The Anim Notifies window is best thought of as an Animation Notifies manager as you can see all the currently assigned custom notifies and which animation the notify is associated with, as well as delete or rename a notify, however you cannot create new notifies from this window as that is done inside the [](Engine/Animation/Persona/AssetEditor) of the animation asset itself. 

## Viewing the Animation Notifies Window

To view the **Animation Notifies** window, open a **Skeleton** asset from the **Content Browser**:
