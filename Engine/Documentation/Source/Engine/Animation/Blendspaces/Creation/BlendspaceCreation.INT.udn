This page covers how to create both **Blend Space** and **Blend Space 1D** assets using a [Skeleton](Engine/Animation/Skeleton) to associate the Blend Space with.

## Steps

[REGION:note]
Creating a Blend Space and Blend Space 1D are generally the same, however, [](Engine/Animation/Blendspaces/Editor) slightly differs based on which asset you are working with. 
[/REGION]

1. In the **Content Browser** of your project, click the **Add New** button (or right-click in the Content Browser) and choose **Animation** > **Blend Space**.

	If you would like to create a **Blend Space 1D**, select the option for Blend Space 1D instead.

	Your list of assets may look different based on the number of Skeleton Assets you have in your project. 
	[/REGION]

1.  Enter a name for your new Blend Space asset.

	The Blend Space is also available to be used in the **Anim Graphs** of Animation Blueprints targeting the same Skeleton as the Blend Space:

After creating a Blend Space, you can open it and it will appear empty (below).

From here you can begin creating [](Engine/Animation/AnimHowTo/BlendSpace) or your desired blending effect.
