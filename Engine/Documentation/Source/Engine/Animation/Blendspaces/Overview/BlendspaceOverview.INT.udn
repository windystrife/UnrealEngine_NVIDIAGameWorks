[TOC (start:2 end:2)]

The goal of a **Blend Space** is to reduce the need for creating individual, hard-coded nodes for blending
animations with an asset that performs blending based on specific properties or conditions instead. By enabling the animator or programmer to specify 
the inputs, the animations, and how the inputs are used to blend between animations, virtually any 
type of blending can be performed using the generic Blend Space. 

This is completely contrary to how AnimTrees in Unreal Engine 3 handled the same tasks. 
Any complex blending required the creation of a new node to handle that blending. 
Blend Spaces are completely generic enabling the factors that determine the blending to be specified on each individual Blend Space. 
Each Blend Space has inputs that simply take in values. 
These values can be calculated during the update cycle of an [Animation Blueprint](Engine\Animation\AnimBlueprints) (via the **EventGraph**), 
driven by gameplay code, or any other means (as seen in the example chart below). This makes them extremely flexible and puts the power into 
the hands of the person creating the AnimGraph to blend animations in any way they see fit.

## Blend Space

You can think of a Blend Space like a 2D graph with each input value along one axis and animations plotted 
on the graph at various points. The blended animation is calculated by blending between the animations 
on the graph based on the location designated by the current input values.
As an example, take the typical blending between directional run animations and an idle animation based on 
the direction and speed of the movement of the player.

In Unreal Engine 3, this was performed using the directional blending node in combination with a speed 
blending node. Each of these nodes was hard-coded to only do that specific blend. The values used to 
perform the blending were hidden away in the code, so no modifications could be made to tweak the blend 
except by a programmer; and if you modified the value in the code, it affected every instance of the node 
in every AnimTree making use of it. This is far from ideal.

With Blend Spaces, this same blend can be performed using a single Blend Space. 
The direction (which is indicated in the horizontal yellow box below) and speed (indicated in the vertical yellow box below) of the player would be values passed to the Blend Space as inputs.
The animations (white diamonds below) would be set up to blend appropriately based on the values of these inputs resulting in the final pose you see (green diamond below) in-game.

Below, our **AnimGraph** implements the Blend Space to which we can adjust our inputs (in this case **Speed**) to drive the blending.

Just as in the previewer, as we adjust our input values we alter and drive the blending in our Blend Space. 

## Blend Space 1D

Blend Spaces can also be created in a one-dimensional format, known as a **Blend Space 1D**. These can blend between any number of poses or animations but do so based on a single input value. 
An example use case for a Blend Space 1D would be when you have a character that automatically orientates towards the direction they are moving. 
If the character cannot sidestep or move in multiple directions, a Blend Space 1D could be used to blend from an Idle to a Walk and ultimately Run based on a single **Speed** value (as shown in the example below).

[REGION:note]
Aside from having only one axis instead of two, a Blend Space 1D is exactly the same as a standard two-axis Blend Space.
