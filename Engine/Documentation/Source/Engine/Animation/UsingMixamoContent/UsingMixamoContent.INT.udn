The 15 characters provided in the Mixamo Animation Pack can be added to your project, either as a Character Blueprint or as a combination of a Skeletal Mesh and Animation Blueprint.
The first method is a quick and easy way to drop a third-person character into your project, complete with movement controls and attacking. The second method allows you to change the 
look of a character you already have, or in different styles of templates, if the movement and inputs have similar setups to the Mixamo base character. 

## Third-Person Blueprint Character

## General Usage

If your project is based on one of the following templates, you can use this more general setup. It will work for both Blueprints and C++ versions of these templates.

* Side Scroller
* Top Down
* Third Person

[REGION:tip]
These steps assume that your project has movement and input setups compatible with the Mixamo animations. If you have your own project, or have substantially changed a template's setup, you
may need to add input bindings, or add Blueprints and/or C++ code to trigger the animations.

1. Create a new project based on one of the above templates. If you choose a C++ template, compile it in **Development Editor** and then open it in the editor. In this example, we are using the Top Down C++ template.
