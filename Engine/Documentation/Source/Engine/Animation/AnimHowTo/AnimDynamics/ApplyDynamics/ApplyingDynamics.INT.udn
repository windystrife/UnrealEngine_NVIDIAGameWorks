%Steps%

Now that our character is set up with an **Animation Blueprint** and has bones that we want to dynamically animate, we can do so from the **AnimGraph** of our **Animation Blueprint** with the **AnimDynamics** node. 

In our example, the character is carrying a large furnace around their neck that we want to be animated based on character movement. If you are using your own character, you can follow the steps below and assign the bone(s) you want to drive with AnimDynamics and adjust the settings as desired. 

## Steps

1. In the **Content Browser**, open the character's **Animation Blueprint** (**GruntAnimBP**). 

	![](1_OpenAnimBP.png)

1. Click **MyBlueprint**, then **AnimGraph** to open the Animation Graph. 

	![](2_AnimGraph.png)

1. **Right-click** in the graph and search for and add the **AnimDynamics** node.

	The AnimDynamics node takes in an **External Force** value which is additional force to apply to all bodies in the simulation (this is optional but may be something to consider). It also takes in the **Component Pose** which is the reference pose data as well as an **Alpha** value (the strength in which to apply the skeletal control where 0 is no strength and 1 is full strength). 

1. **Copy** and **Paste** the node, then connect the nodes as shown below.

	[REGION:caption]
	The **Local to Component** and **Component to Local** will be automatically created when connecting pose pins. 
	[/REGION]

	In our example we are using two AnimDynamics nodes (one to affect the Harness and another to affect the Furnace). 

1.	Select the first **AnimDynamics** node in the sequence, then in the **Details** panel assign the settings shown below. 

	![](5_Furnance1.png)

	The **Preview** section is all about visualization which help to indicate the current limits applied to the movement in the viewport. You can also see Collision Spheres if you are using **Planar Limits** and **CoM** (Center of Mass) is not enabled (which is outside the scope of this example but you can experiement with this setting). 
	
	The last thing we set is the **Bound Bone** or bone we are affecting which we set to the **furnace** bone on our character (this bone affects the Harness). 

1.	With the node still selected, set the **Setup** and **Constraint** sections as shown below. 
	
	![](6_Furnance1.png)

	The **Setup** and **Constraint** sections are where you define the movement and range of movement for the bone driven by AnimDynamics. The **Box Extent** provides the inertia, the **Local Joint Offset** defines the pivot point and **Angular Limits** provide the rotational range of movement (which is indicated by the preview visualization options when enabled). 

	[REGION:note]
	Please see [**AnimDynamics**](Engine\Animation\NodeReference\SkeletalControls) section of Skeletal Controls for more information on Setup and Constraint settings. 
	[/REGION]

1.	Click **Compile** and notice how the harness object tilts to the side. 

	![](6_Furnance1b.png)

	The Angular Limits for the **Y** axis is quite large right now indicated by the green cone in the picture above. Let's reduce this range. 

1.	With the node still selected, in the **Constraints** section, adjust the **Angular Limits** for **Min/Max** as shown below. 

	![](6_Furnance1c.png)

	When you **Compile** this time, the harness should not shift as much to either side (even if you adjust the **Speed** or **IsInAir?** settings). 

	![](6_Furnanced.png)

1.	Select the second **AnimDynamics** node in the sequence and use the following settings.

	[/REGION]

	_Click for full view._	

	With the settings above, we changed the **Bound Bone** to now target the **Furnace_Pivot** bone in our character which affects the furnace object. We also adjusted the **Twist Axis** so that it twists on the **Y** axis providing back-and-forth movement instead of side-to-side. The Angular Limits are set to **-50** and **50** as the range in which to move. 

1.	**Compile** and **Save** then play in the editor.


## End Result

You should now see that the furnace for our example character bounces around as the character moves based on our constraint settings.

Feel free to experiment with the **Box Extent** and **Local Joint Offset** values in the **Setup** section as well as the **Linear** and **Angular Limits** in the **Constraints** section to see how it alters the movement of our bones affected by AnimDynamics.
