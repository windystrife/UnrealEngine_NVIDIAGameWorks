[Blend Spaces](Engine/Animation/Blendspaces) are special assets which can be sampled in **AnimGraphs** that allow for blending of animations based on the values of two inputs. 
Simple blending between two animations based on a single input can be performed using one of the standard [Blend Nodes](Engine/Animation/NodeReference/Blend) available in Animation Blueprints. 
Blend Spaces provide a means of doing more complex blending between multiple animations based on multiple values (currently limited to two).

In this How-to, we use a Blend Space to blend between walking and jogging animations based on the character's movement speed and movement direction.

## Steps

[REGION:note]
For this guide, we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** project and have added the **Animation Starter Pack** to the project.

You can download the Animation Starter pack for free through the **Marketplace** from the Epic Launcher. 

[/REGION]

1.  In your project in the **Content/ThirdPersonBP/Blueprints** folder, open the **ThirdPersonGameMode** and set the **Default Pawn Class** to **Ue4ASP_Character**. 

	![](BlendSpace1.png)

	This will allow us to use the playable character that was created along with the Animation Starter Pack project. 

1.	In the Level, select the **ThirdPersonCharacter** and delete it from the level. 

	![](BlendSpace2.png)

	We need to delete this character from the level in order to spawn in as the character from the previous step. 

1.	In the **Content/AnimStarterPack/UE4_Mannequin/Mesh** folder, right-click on the **UE4_Mannequin** and under **Create**, select **Blend Space** and give it a name.

	![](BlendSpace3.png)

	Blend Space assets need a Skeleton asset to reference, here we are using a shortcut to create a Blend Space from this Skeleton asset which we called **MyBlendSpace**.

1.	Inside the Blend Space, in the **Asset Details** panel under **Axis Settings**, add the following values: 

	![](BlendSpace4.png)

	The Horizontal Axis will determine the **Direction** we are moving in degrees: 

	|Horizontal Axis Settings | Value|
	|---|---|
	|**Name**| Direction |
	|**Minimum Axis Value**| -180 |
	|**Maximum Axis Value**| 180 |
	|**Number of Grid Divisions**| 4 |
	|**Interpolation Time**| 0 |
	|**Interpolation Type**| Averaged Interpolation |

	The Vertical Axis will determine the **Speed** in which our character is moving: 

	|Vertical Axis Settings | Value|
	|---|---|
	|**Name**| Speed |
	|**Minimum Axis Value**| 0 |
	|**Maximum Axis Value**| 250 |
	|**Number of Grid Divisions**| 4 |
	|**Interpolation Time**| 0 |
	|**Interpolation Type**| Averaged Interpolation |

1.	In the **Asset Browser**, drag the **Walk_Fwd_Rifle_Ironsights** animation to the center-bottom position on the grid. 

	![](BlendSpace5.png)

	This will be are starting position when we enter this Blend Space. 

1.	Drag the **Walk_Lt_Rifle_Ironsights** animation to location **1** and **Walk_Rt_Rifle_Ironsights** animation to location **2** below. 

	![](BlendSpace6.png)

	Here we place the animations to use when moving left or right. 

1.	Drag the **Walk_Bwd_Rifle_Ironsights** animation to locations **1** and **2** below.

	![](BlendSpace7.png)

	Here we place the animation to use when moving backward. 

1.	From the **Asset Browser**, drag the **Jog_Fwd_Rifle** animation to the top-center position on the grid. 

	![](BlendSpace8.png)

	This allows us to use a different animation when our speed is at max 250 and we are not moving left or right, we are jogging forward. 

1.	Drag the **Jog_Lt_Rifle** animation to location **1** and **Jog_Rt_Rifle** animation to location **2** below. 

	![](BlendSpace9.png)

1.	Drag the **Jog_Bwd_Rifle** animation to locations **1** and **2** below.

	![](BlendSpace10.png)

1.	In the **Content/AnimStarterPack** folder, open the **UE4ASP_HeroTPP_AnimBlueprint** then in the **My Blueprint** panel, **Double-click** the **Locomotion** graph. 

	![](BlendSpace11.png)

1.	**Double-click** the **Jog** State to open its graph. 

	![](BlendSpace12.png)

	This [State Machine](Engine/Animation/StateMachines) already has a Jog State and in it, a Blend Space for different Jogging motions. 

1.	From the **Asset Browser**, drag the **MyBlendSpace** asset into the graph and replace the **BS_Jog** Blend Space as shown below. 

	![](BlendSpace13.png)

	The default Blend Space does not include Walking states which our Blend Space does, so let's replace it with ours! 

1.	In the **Content/AnimStarterPack** folder, open the **Ue4ASP_Character**. 

1.	Locate the section marked **Crouch** in the graph and delete it to remove the warning error. 

	![](BlendSpace14.png)

	By default, the Animation Starter Pack has bindings created for crouch which our project does not. For this example, we will remove the ability to crouch walk. 

1.	Right-click in the graph and add a **Left Shift** Key Event, then drag the **CharacterMovement** into the graph from the **Components** tab. 

	![](BlendSpace15.png)

	When we press and hold the Left Shift button, that will toggle us from walking into a jog. 

1.	Drag off the **CharacterMovement** node and **Set Max Walk Speed** for **Pressed** and **Released** with the values **250** and **100** respectively. 

	![](BlendSpace17.png)

	We are changing our movement speed based on if Left Shift is held and will alter our character's movement speed in-game. 

1.	Click the **CharacterMovement** component, then in the **Details** panel set the **Max Walk Speed** to **100**. 

	![](BlendSpace20.png)

	We need to update our character's default movement speed so they start out walking. 

1.	Click the **CapsuleComponent** in the **Components** tab and in the **Details** panel, check the **Hidden in Game** option. 

	![](BlendSpace18.png)

	This will turn off the collision capsule debug display in-game. 

1.	Click **Compile** then click the **Play** in editor button from the Toolbar.

When playing in the Editor, using **WASD** to move around, the character will now walk by default and blend between walking animations when changing directions. 
While standing, pressing and holding **Left Shift** while using WASD will cause the character to blend from the walk/aim animation to a lowered/aim jog animation, essentially creating a sprint for the character.
