In this step, we change our default player character and create an AnimMontage for the animation we want to layer in on top of our movement animations. 

[EXCERPT:INTRO]
[REGION:note]
For this guide we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** project and have added the **Animation Starter Pack** to the project:

You can download the Animation Starter Pack for free through the **Marketplace** from the Epic Launcher.

[/EXCERPT:INTRO]

1.  With your project open, inside the **Content Browser** under the **Content/ThirdPersonBP/Blueprints** folder, open the **ThirdPersonGameMode** Blueprint. 

1.	Under **Default Pawn Class**, click the drop-down menu and select the **Ue4ASP_Character**.

1.	**Compile** and **Save** then close the Blueprint. 

1.	In the **Content Browser**, open the **Content/AnimStarterPack** folder. 

1.	**Right-click** on the **Fire_Shotgun_Ironsights** animation, select **Create** then **Create AnimMontage**.

	You can filter the window by typing "Fire" inside the search window as shown above. 
	[/REGION]
1.	Open the new AnimMontage and click the magnifying glass icon. 

	![](Animations3.png)

	This will open the **Anim Slot Manager** which we will use to create a **Slot** that we can use to blend to when calling the Slot by name. 

1.	Click the **Add Slot** button, then name the slot **UpperBody** then click **Save**.

	[REGION:note]
	Although we chose the name "UpperBody" here, we are not targeting the upperbody just yet but have assigned the name so we know where we are targeting.
	[/REGION]

1.	Click the drop-down menu inside the **Montage Group** section and change it to **DefaultGroup.UpperBody**, then close the window. 

	![](Animations5.png)

	We have now associated this Montage with the **DefaultGroup.UpperBody**, allowing it to play when the Slot is called.  

In the next section, we will change our default player character and make some adjustments to determine when we are firing a weapon.
