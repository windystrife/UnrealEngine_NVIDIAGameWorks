In this step, we create some script inside our Character Blueprint to allow us to signal our Animation Blueprint that we are firing a weapon. 

1.	Inside the **Content Browser** under **Content/AnimStarterPack**, open the **Ue4ASP_Character** Blueprint. 

1.	Locate the **Crouching** section, and delete the **InputAction Crouch** Event (with the Warning!) sign.

	There is a warning on this node because our project is not set up to use the InputAction event "Crouch". 

1.	**Right-click** in the graph and add a **C** Key Event and connect as shown below.

	We have just associated crouch now with the **C** key press, you can change this input to whatever you would like. 

1.	In the **MyBlueprint** window, click the **Add Variable** button to create a **Boolean** variable and call it **Fire Button Down**.

1.	**Right-click** in the graph and add the **Left Mouse Button** Key Event. 

1.	Holding **Alt**, drag the **Fire Button Down** variable in the graph to create a **Set** node. 

1.	Repeat the previous step (or copy the **Set** node) and connect as shown below.

	Make sure that **Fire Button Down** is **True** when **Left Mouse Button** is **Pressed** and **False** when **Released**. 

1.	Select **CapsuleComponent** in the **Components** window, then in the **Details** panel check the **Hidden in Game** option.

	This will turn off the debug display of capsule's collision. 

1.	**Compile** and **Save** then close the Blueprint. 

Our character is now set up to send signals to our Animation Blueprint when we are crouching or firing a weapon. 
In the next step, we will set up our Animation Graph inside our Animation Blueprint to handle the blending of our Anim Montage with our normal movement animations so that we can blend between the two.
