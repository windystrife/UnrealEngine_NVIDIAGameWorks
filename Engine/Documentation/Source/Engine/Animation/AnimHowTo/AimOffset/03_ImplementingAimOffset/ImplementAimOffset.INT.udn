In this step, we add the Aim Offset to our Animation Blueprint and hook it up to our existing Anim Graph. 

## Steps

1. In the **Content/AnimStarterPack** folder, open the **UE4ASP_HeroTPP_AnimBlueprint** and **Double-click** the **AnimGraph** in the **MyBlueprint** panel.

1. From the **Asset Browser** tab, drag in your Aim Offset asset. 

	![](step3_02.png)

1. Connect the Aim Offset as shown below, then **Right-click** on the **Yaw** and **Pitch** pins and **Promote to Variable** and name them **Aim Yaw** and **Aim Pitch**. 

	![](step3_03.png)

	These two variables will be populated by where the player is aiming using their mouse and will drive the pose in our Aim Offset. 

1. In the **MyBlueprint** panel, jump over to the **EventGraph**. 

	![](step3_04.png)

1. In the **EventGraph**, locate the **Sequence** node within the Movement portion of the script. 

	![](step3_05.png)

	Click the **Add pin** button on the **Sequence** node. 

	![](step3_05b.png)

1. From the **MyBlueprint** panel, hold down **Alt** and drag in both the **Aim Yaw** and **Aim Pitch** and connect to **Sequence** node. 

	![](step3_06.png)

1. Drag off the **Cast To Ue4ASP_Character** node and add the **Get Control Rotation** and **Get Actor Rotation** nodes. 

	![](step3_07.png)

1. Drag off the **Get Control Rotation** node and add a **Delta(Rotator)** node. 

	![](step3_08.png)

1. Connect the **Get Actor Rotation** to the **Delta(Rotator) B Pin**, then off the **Return Value** add an **RInterp To** node (and swap the connection from Current to Target). 

	![](step3_09.png)

	[REGION:tip]
	You can hold **Ctrl** and **Left-click** on the **Current** pin to drag its connection to the **Target** pin. 
	[/REGION]

1. Drag off the **Current** pin of the **RInterp To** node and select **Make Rotator**. 

	![](step3_10.png)

1. From the **MyBlueprint** panel, hold **Ctrl** and drag in the **Aim Pitch** and **Aim Yaw** variables and connect them to the **Make Rotator** node's **Pitch** and **Yaw**. 

	![](step3_11.png)

1. At the start of the **Movement** script, find the **Event Blueprint Update Animation** node and promote **Delta Time X** to a variable called **Time** and connect as shown. 

	![](step3_12.png)

1. Back on the **RInterp To** node, connect the new **Time** variable and set the **Interp Speed** to **15**. 

	![](step3_13.png)

	We are going to use the rotation of the character and the rotation of the player's input to create a new rotator that will limit how much the character can turn in a direction. 

1. Off the **RInterp To** node, add a **Break Rotator** and **Clamp Angle** of **Pitch** and **Yaw** with min/max angles set to **-90** and **90** respectively. 

	![](step3_14.png)

1. Connect the **Clamp Angle** from the **Pitch** to **Aim Pitch** and the **Yaw** to **Aim Yaw**. 

	![](step3_15.png)

	The Aim Yaw and Aim Pitch values that drive our Aim Offset now take into account the character's rotation, the player's current controller rotation and are clamped to prevent the character from turning too far in one direction. 
	Without clamping the angle degrees, the character's legs could be pointed forwards while the character turns all the way around and points in the opposite direction which is probably something we want to avoid. 

We are just about done with our setup, in the next step, we will tie everything together and test out our character's ability to aim.
