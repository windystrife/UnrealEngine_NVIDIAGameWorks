After creating [](Engine/Animation/AnimPose), one way of driving and playing back a **Pose Asset** at runtime is through the **Pose by Name** and **Pose Blender** nodes: 

* **Pose by Name** - where you can get the transform of a pose by its name. 
* **Pose Blender** - which outputs the correct pose driven by curves from a Source Pose. 

[REGION:note]
See [](Engine/Animation/AnimHowTo/CreatePoseAsset) for a step-by-step guide of creating a Pose Asset.

In the example below, we have a face that uses a Pose Asset to smile when the player is close and frown when they move away.

Our State Machine inside our Animation Blueprint is set up with three states: 

![](StateMachine.png)

Our default **State** which is our neutral expression, our **Smile** state which is entered when the player enters a trigger volume and our **Frown** state when the player leaves the trigger volume. 
In this example, we only move between smiling and frowning states after triggering the first smile. Inside each state, we use the **Pose Blender** and our animation sequence to apply the curve driven animation.

Pose Blender nodes are created automatically when dragging a Pose Asset into the graph.

### Additional Information

Plugging an Animation Sequence directly into the Final Animation Pose without using a Pose Blender will not automatically apply the curve driven animation.

Additionally, using only a Pose Blender node without supplying any incoming curve data to drive those poses will not output your desired pose. 

![](NoCurveData.png)

You will need to use a method to drive the curve data along with the Pose Driver node to effectively manipulate the final pose. 

![](PoseBlender.png)

You can also convert a Pose Blender to a Pose by Name (or a Pose by Name to a Pose Blender) node through the right-click context menu. 

![](PoseByName.png)

The Pose by Name will enable you to manually specify which pose to use inside the **Details** panel that is used inside the **Pose Asset**. 

![](AdditivePoseByName.png)

For our example, we are controlling two aspects of our character's face, the right side of a smile and the left side of a smile, therefore, a Pose Blender make more sense to use.
If we wanted to control only one pose within our Pose Asset, the Pose by Name provides the ability to control a single pose by its name (which is usually good for full body context). 

[REGION:note]
If you are using a Pose Asset with **Additive** enabled, you will also need to use the **Apply Additive** node to correctly display your desired pose. 
For Pose Assets that are not Additive, you can directly link a Pose by Name node to the Final Animation Pose output.
