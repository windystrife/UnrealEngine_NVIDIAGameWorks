Inside a [Pose Asset](Engine\Animation\AnimPose) you can specify if you want the animation to be **Additive** or non-additive in the form of **Full Body**.

Usually, for full body animation, you will want to leave this as non-additive. This creates 0 or 1 weight values (0.2 is the same as 1 for example). 
Setting to **Additive** and providing a value between 0 and 1 might cause your character to compact, expand or scale undesirably. 
However, for facial animation, enabling **Additive** will give you more precision between min/max influence of a given curve.

You can also specify the Base Pose to use when converting to **Additive**.
