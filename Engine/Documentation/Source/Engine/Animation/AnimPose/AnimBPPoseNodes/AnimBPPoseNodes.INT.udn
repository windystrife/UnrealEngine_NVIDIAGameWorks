[Pose Assets](Engine\Animation\AnimPose) can be driven at runtime with **Animation Blueprints** as the **AnimGraph** supports a few different Pose Nodes. 

## Pose by Name / Pose Blender Nodes

One way of driving **Pose Assets** is through the **Pose by Name** and **Pose Blender** nodes: 

* **Pose by Name** - where you can get the transform of a pose by its name. 
* **Pose Blender** - which outputs the correct pose driven by curves from a Source Pose. 

In the example below, we have a face that uses a **Pose Asset** to smile when the player is close and frown when moving away.

Our State Machine inside our Animation Blueprint is set up with three states: 

![](StateMachine.png)

Our default **State** which is our neutral expression, our **Smile** state which is entered when the player enters a trigger volume and our **Frown** state when the player leaves the trigger volume. 
In this example, we only move between smiling and frowning states after triggering the first smile. Inside each state, we use the **Pose Blender** and our animation sequence to apply the curve driven animation.

Pose Blender nodes are created automatically when dragging a **Pose Asset** into the graph. 

If you plug an AnimSequence directly into the Final Animation Pose without using a Pose Blender (below), you will not see the curve driven animation applied.

Additionally, using just a Pose Blender without supplying any incoming curve data will not output your desired pose.

You can also convert a Pose Blender node to a **Pose by Name** (which can also be converted to a Pose Blender node) through the right-click context menu.

This will allow you to manually specify which pose to use inside the **Details** panel from the **Pose Asset**.

For our example we are controlling two aspects of our character's face, the right side of a smile and the left side of a smile so a **Pose Blender** make more sense to use.
If we wanted to control only one pose within our **Pose Asset**, the **Pose by Name** grants us the ability to control a single pose by its name (which is usually good for full body context). 

[REGION:note]
If you are using a **Pose Asset** with **Additive** enabled, you will also need to use the **Apply Additive** node to correctly display your desired pose. For **Pose Assets** that are not **Additive**, you can directly link a **Pose by Name** node to the **Final Animation Pose** output.

## Pose Driver Node

Available within the AnimGraph of an Animation Blueprint is the **Pose Driver** node which allows a bone to drive other aspects of animation, based on a set of 'example poses' or lets you drive a curve value based on a bone's movement. 
One use for this node would be to create a pose space deformer to drive corrective blend shapes based on a bone's orientation or translation. 
For example, in the clip below, clavicle bone poses are being used to move the shoulder relative to the arm bone's movement.

To achieve this, a **RBF (Radial Basis Function)** interpolates driven values based on the orientation of a target bone. 
You will need to create a **Pose Asset** and define the target poses for the bone and the desired curve values at each pose. 

On the **Pose Driver** node itself, you have the following options: 

![](PoseDriverNode.png)

| Option | Description |
| ----------- |------|
| **Source Bone** | Bone to use for driving parameters based on its orientation. | 
| **Radial Scaling** | Scaling of radial basis, applied to max distance between poses.| 
| **Pose Source** | The **Pose Asset** used as the source of pose data. | 
| **Include Ref Pose as Neutral Pose** | Should the mesh ref pose of Source Bone be considered as a "neutral pose" (zero curves). | 
| **Type** | [INCLUDE:Engine\Animation\AnimPose\AnimBPPoseNodes\#typetable] | 
| **Twist Axis** | The axis to use when **Type** is set to **SwingOnly** (X, Y or Z). | 

<!--
[EXCERPT:typetable]
| Option | Description |
| ----------- |------|
| **Swing and Twist** | Consider full rotation for interpolation. | 
| **Swing Only** | Consider only swing for interpolation. | 
| **Translation** | Consider translation relative to parent. |
