## Creating Transition Rules

**Transition Rules** are methods of controlling flow inside a [State Machine](Engine/Animation/StateMachines) and are automatically created along the wires that connect **States** and **Conduits**. These Transition Rules can perform any number of checks and tests against variable values, all with the purpose of outputting a true or false value which then determines whether the animation can move through the transition or not.

Connecting States or Conduits together can be performed by **left-clicking** and dragging from one State (or Conduit) to another: 

![](ConnectStates.png)(w:540)

After a connection is made, a Transition Rule appears as a small circular directional icon inside the wired connection:

![](TransitionRule.png)(w:540)

When you mouse over the icon, a visual indication of what the rule is will be displayed: 

![](TransitionRuleMouseOver.png)(w:540)

_In this example, in order for **JumpLoop** to transition to **JumpEnd**, the variable **IsInAir?** must be **NOT** true._ 

Rules can also be set to determine flow for a transition in both directions as well:

This means that a rule can be set to exit one state to move to another and a rule can be applied to transition back to that state. 


## Editing Transition Rules

**Double-clicking** on a **Transition Rule** will open a window where you can define the variables that must be met for the transition to occur. 

![](EditRule.png)(w:840)

Similar to **Blueprints**, you can specify variables in the **My Blueprint** window and drag them into the graph. By connecting the variables to various conditions which are then connected to the **Result** node, you can define what must be _true_ (or _false_) in order for the transition to occur. 

[REGION:note]
For information on getting started with Blueprints, refer to the [Introduction to Blueprints](Engine/Blueprints/GettingStarted) documentation.

## Transition Rules Details

When **Left-clicking** on the Transition Rule, the **Details** panel will update and additional options will become available. 

![](TransitionDetails.png)

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Transition Priority Order** | The priority order of the transition. If multiple transitions out of a state are _true_ at the same time, the one with the lowest number for priority order will take precedent. |
| **Bidirectional** | Determines if the transition can go both directions. |
| **Blend Logic** | Specifies what transition logic to use: Standard Blend or [Custom Blend](#customblendnodes). Selecting Custom will enable you to enter the Blend Graph to set a custom Blend Transition. |
| **Transition Rule Sharing** | This option allows you to set whether or not the rule can be shared with other transitions or to use the rule from another transition.  |
| **Automatic Rule Based on Sequence Player in State** | This will try to set the rule automatically based on most relevant player node's remaining time and the Crossfade Duration of the transition, ignoring the internal time. |
| **Transition Interrupt** | Set the Trigger Weight Threshold and specify a Notify State Class.  |
| **Transition Crossfade Sharing** | Use an existing Transition Crossfade Blend or promote the existing Transition Crossfade to shared.  |
| **Duration** | The duration to apply to the cross-fade. |
| **Mode** | The type of blending applied to the cross-fade. See [](Engine\Animation\NonLinearBlends) for more information. |
| **Custom Blend Curve** | Takes in a user specified blend curve and applies it during the blend. |
| **Blend Profile** | The blend profile used to evaluate this transition per-bone.  |
| **Start Transition Event / Custom Blueprint Event** | Call and execute an Event from within the notified Blueprint at the start of the transition. |
| **End Transition Event / Custom Blueprint Event** | Call and execute an Event from within the notified Blueprint at the end of the transition. |
| **Interrupt Transition Event / Custom Blueprint Event** | Call and execute an Event from within the notified Blueprint when the transition is interrupted. |


## Additional Considerations

When working with child [Animation Blueprints](Engine/Animation/AnimBlueprints) and overriding animations in a State Machine, animations referenced by transition rules do not have to be the same length in every child Animation Blueprint. When using nodes like the **Time Remaining** node (which can be used to determine how much time is remaining in an animation and can be used as part of a Transition Rule), these type of nodes correctly responds to changes in animation length when animations are overridden in child Animation Blueprints. 

Also, rather than targeting a specific animation as part of your Transition Rule that might change or may be overridden, you can use several class-based get nodes that always pick the highest weighted animation from the source state (pictured below).

![](GetRelevantNodes.png)

| **No.** | **Node** |**Description**|
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Get Relevant Anim Length (Movement)**| Gets the length in seconds of the most relevant animation in the source state.|
| 2 | **Get Relevant Anim Time (Movement)**|Gets the current accumulated time in seconds for the most relevant animation in the source state. |
| 3 | **Get Relevant Anim Time Fraction (Movement)**| Gets the current accumulated time as a fraction of the length of the most relevant animation in the source state. |
| 4 | **Get Relevant Anim Time Remaining (Movement)**| Gets the time remaining in seconds for the most relevant animation in the source state. |
| 5 | **Get Relevant Anim Time Remaining Fraction (Movement)**|Gets the time remaining as a fraction of the duration for the most relevant animation in the source state. |

### Custom Blend Nodes

In addition to the nodes cited above, there is also information exposed inside Custom Blend Graphs to allow them to be used for more than just a one-shot custom transition animation. 

![](CustomBlendNodes.png)

| **No.** | **Node** |**Description**|
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **State Weight**| Gets the blend weight of a specified state. |
| 2 | **Get Transition Time Elapsed**| Gets the elapsed time in seconds of a specified transition. |
| 3 | **Get Transition Time Elapsed (ratio)**| Gets the elapsed time as a fraction of the crossfade duration of a specified transition. |
| 4 | **Get Transition Crossfade Duration**| Gets the crossfade duration of a specified transition. |

You can also use get nodes that reference the asset players, just like a Transition Rule. 

[REGION:note]
If you have an understanding of Animation Programming in Unreal, [Native Getters](Programming/Animation/AnimNodes) can also be used to improve performance.
