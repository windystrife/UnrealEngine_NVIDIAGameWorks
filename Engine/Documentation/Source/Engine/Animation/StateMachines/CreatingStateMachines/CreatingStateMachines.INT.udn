Before actually creating your [State Machine](Engine\Animation\StateMachines\Overview), it is a good idea to take a little time and plan out exactly which states you will need, as well as the circumstances that will drive transitions between states. This will give you a solid plan of attack for not only the State Machine but also the variables you will need to drive it and which animations will be a part of each state.

You can create a **New State Machine** inside the **AnimGraph** of an **Animation Blueprint Editor**: 

1. **Right-click** within the AnimGraph of your [Animation Blueprint](Engine\Animation\AnimBlueprints) and choose **State Machines > New State Machine** from the context menu.

	Generally, it is a good idea to name your State Machine immediately after creation. 
	
1.	**Right-click** the new State Machine in the **My Blueprint** window and enter a new name in the name field.

	In this case, the State Machine has been named "Locomotion."

1.	You can open the State Machine to define its States and Transitions by **Double-clicking** it.

	This will open a new graph tab with nothing but an Entry point, which essentially kicks off the animation.

## Creating States and Conduits

Creating a new State is similar to creating new nodes within a Blueprint. 

1. You can **Right-click** and create one from the context menu.

	 You can also drag a wire into an empty portion of the graph and release the mouse, which will also expose the context menu.

1.	You can rename your States by **Right-clicking** the node in the graph.

	Above our State has been created and renamed to **Idle** below.

1.	Conduits are created in a similar manner, by either **Right-clicking** in the graph or dragging a new wire into an empty space on the graph.

## Creating Transition Rules

[Transition Rules](Engine\Animation\StateMachines\TransitionRules) are created automatically along the wires that connect States and Conduits. Graphically, Transition Rules appear as a small circular directional icon, like so:

This means that when you create a new State or Conduit by dragging a wire into an empty space on the graph, a Transition Rule will automatically be created for that wire. Additionally, you can drag a wire back to the original node to create a second Transition Rule for transitioning back to that node.

You can **Double-click** on a Transition Rule to open a new graph that will allow you to define the success or fail conditions for the transition.

Above if the Boolean **IsSecondaryAttacking?** is **True**, then the transition into the new state can occur.
