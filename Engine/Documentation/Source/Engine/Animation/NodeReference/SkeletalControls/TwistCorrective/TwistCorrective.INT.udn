The **Twist Corrective** node is a node that can drive curve values, such as **Morph Targets**, based on the twist of one bone relative to another. As an example, when the neck is twisted too far to the right or left you can apply a Morph Target to the neck in order to create a more natural look.

You can specify the **Base Frame** and **Twist Frame** using bone name and local axis, and a **Twist Normal** as the axis of the twist. 

For example, if you'd like to check the twist to the right side along the Y axis, the normal would be (0, 1, 0). Or, if you'd like to check the twist to the left side along the Y axis, the normal would be (0, -1, 0). If you'd like to twist up/center along the Z axis, the normal would be (0, 0, 1). The Angle will be calculated between the plane and the twist frame.

Angle Delta of the range **Max Angle in Degree** will be mapped to **Mapped Range Min** and **Mapped Range Max** using a named curve.

You can add the Twist Corrective node in the **AnimGraph** of your **Animation Blueprint**.

| Pin | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Input Pins**[/REGION] ||
| **Component Pose** | The input pose to be transformed. |
| **Alpha** | A float value in the range [0.0, 1.0] to use as the alpha value to determine the weighting of the Transform applied by the SkeletalControl. A value of 0.0 gives full weighting to the input pose, while a value of 1.0 gives full weighting to the control's computed Transform. |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Output Pins**[/REGION] ||
| Pose (Blank) | The final pose after the Transform has been applied. |

**Twist Corrective** nodes are also affected by the **LOD Threshold** system introduced in 4.11. You can find the setting for this in the **Details Panel** for the **Twist Corrective** node.
