[EXCERPT:Intro]
**Animation Notifications** (**AnimNotifies** or just **Notifies**) provide a way for animation programmers to setup events to occur at specific points during an **Animation Sequence**. Notifies are commonly used to add effects like footstep sounds during a walk or run animation or spawning a particle system during animation. However, they can have any number of different uses, as the system can be extended with custom notification types to cater to the needs of any type of game.

## Notify Types

Different types of Notifies cause different events to be triggered. Camera effects, particle effects, sounds, etc. can all be triggered at any point during an animation through the use of a Notify. Adding a Notify can be done by **Right-clicking** on a **Notify Track** at the point in the animation you want the Notify to occur, and then choosing one of the type of Notify to add.

[REGION:note]
For more information on adding/editing Notifies, see the [](Engine/Animation/Sequences/Editor) page.

### Play Particle Effect

The **PlayParticleEffect** Notify spawns and plays a particle system at a given socket location and at a specific point along an animation's timeline. This is useful for such effects as causing a cloud of dust to appear around a player's feet when they move, fire to spew from an exhaust pipe when the player uses a Nitro-Boost power-up, or other such effects.

![](PlayParticleEffectNotify.png)

A PlayParticleEffect Notify does not use the Animation Blueprint to control behavior. Instead, it uses a few simple properties defined in the **Details** panel to determine what Particle System is used and from what Socket the particles will originate.

![](PlayParticleEffectDetails.png)

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Socket Name** | This contains the Skeletal Mesh socket that will be used as the spawn point for the particle system. |
| **PSTemplate** | This holds the particle system that will be spawned at the Notifies set point in time. |
| **Attached** | Determines if the effect should attach to the bone/socket. |
| **Location Offset** | Location offset from the socket. |
| **Rotation Offset** | Rotation offset from the socket. |
| **Notify Color** | Changes the color of the Notify on the Notify bar. |

Once set up, the associated Particle System will play, using the Socket location as the spawn point.

### Play Sound

The **PlaySound** Notify provides a simple means to get your sound effects synced with animation. Much like Play Particle Effect, this Notify has a few simple properties that can be set in the **Details** panel, which allow for fast and easy sound effect setup. This is useful for such things as mechanical whirrs when a robot moves, the rustle of cloth during character motion, and similar types of effects.

![](PlaySound.png)

The **Play Sound** Notify uses a few simple properties defined in the **Details** panel to determine what sound effect is used and from what **Socket** or **Bone** the sound will originate.

![](PlaySoundDetails.png)

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Attach Name** | This contains the Skeletal Mesh socket or bone that will be used as the spawn point for the sound effect. |
| **Volume Multiplier** | This scaling multiplier is applied to the volume of the sound effect. |
| **Pitch Multiplier** | This scaling multiplier is applied to the pitch of the sound effect. |
| **Follow** | If checked, the sound effect source will follow the Static Mesh as it moves. If unchecked, the sound remains behind at the location it was spawned. |
| **Notify Color** | Changes the color of the Notify on the Notify bar. |

### Custom Notifies

The **Custom** Notify serves as a catch-all for anything an artist may want to do within a Animation Blueprint at a certain point in an animation. Custom Notifies are created by **Right-clicking** on a Notify track and choosing **New Notify** from the context menu.

![](MySpecialNotify.png)

Custom Notifies allow you to create a **Notify Event** of the same name in the Event Graph or Transition Graphs in the [State Machine](Engine/Animation/StateMachines) for a Skeletal Mesh's [Animation Blueprint](Engine\Animation\AnimBlueprints). To add your Custom Notify, **Right-click** anywhere in your Event or Transition Graphs and there is a section for adding Animation Notifies events.

![](rightClickAddNotify.png)

After adding the Custom Notify, an Event Node will be added to the graph which will be executed when the Notify is called. 

![](MySpecialNotifyBlueprint.png)

## Notify States 

**AnimNotifyStates** (**Notify States**) work much like the standard Notifies above. They have 3 distinct events: a start, the tick, and an end. They start straightforward, firing at the moment the Notify begins and ends, and the **Event Graphs** in them fire off when their time comes up in the animation. The tick fires off every animation update until the end event is hit. The major difference between normal Notifies and Notify States is that Notify States are self-contained [Blueprints](Engine/Blueprints).

Creating Notify States (which are the same as [Native Notify States](#nativenotifystates) but are custom Blueprints that you can provide any logic you need to occurring during an animation) is done the same as adding a regular Notify by **Right-clicking** in the **Notify Track** of an animation and selecting **Add Notify State...** then selecting your custom Notify.

[REGION:note]
To use a custom Notify, you must first [create a Blueprint Class](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Types/ClassBlueprint/Creation) of the AnimNotifyState class. 
[/REGION]

![](addNotifyState.png)

An AnimNotifyState Blueprint Class called **MyAnimNotifyState** (above) was created so that we may select it as the Notify State to use in our animation. Once you have created your Anim Notify State Blueprint, you can open it and begin implementing the functions that determine how your Notify is used (below).

![](animNotifyStateImplementFunction.png)

It is not necessary to implement every function, but at the bare minimum you should implement **Received Notify Tick** or both **Received Notify Start** and **Received Notify End**. If implementing just **Received Notify Start** or **Received Notify End**, you could simply use a standard Animation Notify.

![](Recieved_NotifyStart.png)

_The Notify Start Override._

![](Recieved_NotifyEnd.png)

_The Notify End Override._

![](Recieved_NotifyTick.png)

_The Notify Tick Override._

Below is a description of how each pin type is used in the override functions:

| **Pin** | **Description** |
| --- | ----------- |
| **Mesh Comp** | This is the Skeletal Mesh Component of the Animation Sequence or Montage that is triggering this AnimNotifyState. |
| **Anim Seq** | This is the specific Animation Sequence that is triggering this AnimNotifyState. |
| **Frame Delta Time** | Only in the Received Notify Tick function, this will give you the time since the last animation update. |

[REGION:note]
There is currently no way to retrieve the length of the AnimNotifyState within a Blueprint.
[/REGION]

### Rules

* You are guaranteed to start with a NotifyBegin Event.
* You are guaranteed to end with a NotifyEnd Event.
* You are guaranteed to have NotifyTick wrapped between a NotifyBegin and a NotifyEnd event.
* Order between different AnimNotifies (normal or state) is not guaranteed! If you put two AnimNotifyStates next to each other, the first one is not guaranteed to end before the next one starts. Only use this for individual actions which do not rely on other Notifies.
* Negative play rates are supported. NotifyBegin is still called first regardless, and NotifyEnd called last.

### Order and Logic

When the **AnimNotifyState** is triggered, first the **Start** Blueprint will be called, and then the **Tick** Blueprint is called on the same frame update. Every subsequent tick, only the Tick Blueprint will be called. On the final tick update, the Tick Blueprint will be called followed by the **End** Blueprint.

If you are modifying something every frame, it should go in the Tick Blueprint. If you need to set variables, flags, or properties, to some value before the ticks hit, it should go in the Start Blueprint. And finally, the End Blueprint can be used to change variables, flags, or properties after the final tick hits.


## Native Notify States 
When choosing to add a Notify State, you can also assign one of two **Native Notify States** in the form of a **Timed Particle Effect** or an **Animation Trail**. 

![](AddingNotifyStates.png)

### Timed Particle Effects

The Timed Particle Effect is very similar to the **Play Particle Effect** Notify in that they both allow you to play a Particle Effect at any given point in an animation, the difference however is that with a Timed Particle Effect, you are given the ability to define the length of the effect inside the Notify itself. 

![](TimedParticleEffect.png)

In the image above, a Timed Particle Effect is assigned to an animation. By **Left-Clicking** on the handle bar at the end (or at the start), you can drag to increase or decrease the length of the effect.

### Animation Trails
Animation Trails (or **AnimTrail** for short) are emitters that allow you to leave trails behind moving objects in a scene. 
They do this by sampling the positions of two sockets on a Skeletal Mesh each tick and stitching triangles between the sockets, down the length of the trail. 
  
To use an AnimTrail emitter you must:
1. Create a [Particle System](Engine/Rendering/ParticleSystems) that contains an emitter with AnimTrail type data. 
2. Create and add a Notify State of the **Trail** type to an animation.

<!-- To be included as part of a HowTo.
Setting Up the Particle System

Create a Particle System as usual and add a new emitter with type data AnimTrail to it. 
Several properties of the type data module will affect how the trail behaves. Below is what you should see in **Cascade** when setting up the system. Note, you will see nothing in the preview window as trails must be used in conjunction with a Skeletal Mesh component as explained later.

Below are the properties inside the AnimTrail type data section of the particle system. 

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Dead Trails On Deactivate** | If true, all trails are marked as dead when the system is deactivated as opposed to allowing the particles to expire naturally. This should generally be left as true.  |
| **Enable Previous Tangent Recalculation** | If true, recalculates the previous tangent when a new particle is spawned. Makes the system more expensive but better looking as tangents more accurately match the trails curve.  |
| **Tangent Recalculation Every Frame** | If true, recalculates tangents every frame. Slower but allows the trail particles to use velocity and acceleration etc. |
| **Tiling Distance** | The estimated distance in world units the trail has to travel before the 2nd UV set tiles. If 0.0, the 2nd UV set will not tile. |

**Tessellation Parameters**
 
Tessellation is the process of subdividing geometry into smaller segments. The trails are approximating a curved surface with triangles so we tessellate the trails based on following options so that they fit the curve more accurately and thus are smoother and more aesthetically pleasing. 
However, the more tessellated a trail is, the more expensive it is. 

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Distance Tessellation Step Size** | The (approx.) distance in world units that the trail must be to warrant another tessellation point.   |
| **Tangent Tessellation Step Size** | The (approx.) angle difference in degrees that the tangent must change from one particle to another to warrant another tessellation point. This allows you to ensure that any sharp turns in the trail are nice and smooth.  |
| **Width Tessellation Step Size** | The (approx.) world unit change in the width of the trail that warrants an additional tessellation point.|

Setting Up the AnimNotify

Now that we have a particle system, we must use it with an AnimNotify. 
Open the **Animation Editor**, add or use an existing **Timeline** under the **Notifies** section and **Right-click** on it to bring up the menu. The Trails Notify can be found under the **Add Notify State** section. 

![](SetUpTrail.png)
-->

Once you have added an AnimTrail, you can adjust its properties from the **Details** panel: 

![](TrailDetails.png)

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **PSTemplate** | This is the particle system containing the anim trail that was described above. |
| **First Socket Name** | This is the name of the first Bone/Socket defining the trail. |
| **Second Socket Name** | This is the name of the second Bone/Socket defining the trail. |

The above properties are required but the below are optional. They allow you to alter the width of the trail during the animation. You could also attach the trail to sockets that move as you need but this may not be ideal. 
This method is based on providing a width scale value. A width scale of 1.0 will keep the trail the same width, 0.0 will cause a trail of zero width. 

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Width Scale Curve** | The width value comes from a curve sampled each tick. This property is the name of that Curve. See below for details on creating that curve.  |
| **Width Scale Mode** | This alters the way width is applied. The pictures below show how this works. The example shows a Sine like curve going from 0 to 1 in the middle and back to 0 again. |

![](WidthScaleMode.png)

_The left image depicts From Centre which scales outwards from center, the middle image shows From First Socket which scales away from the first socket and the right image demonstrates From Second Socket which scales away from the second socket._ 

There are also some debug rendering options available:

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Render Geometry** | This toggles the rendering of the main trail geometry.   |
| **Render Spawn Points** | This toggles the debug rendering of the primary spawn points for the trail. i.e. the positions sampled from the sockets at each tick. |
| **Render Tangents** | This toggles the debug rendering of the curve tangents. |
| **Render Tessellation** | This toggles debug rendering of all vertices on the curve. This shows how the curve is tessellated between the spawn points. |

<!-- To be included with AnimTrail HowTo.
### Controlling Animation Trails in Blueprint
While the above method is the standard approach to controlling AnimTrails, you can also control them from inside a Blueprint without the need of an Anim Notify. 
The only restriction with this is that the Particle System Component must be a child of the Skeletal Mesh Component from which you are sampling socket locations. 

1. Create an Emitter component (or use an existing one). 
1. Call the **BeginTrails** function on the component. This will start all trail emitters in the component. You also need to provide the trail's other properties here. 

    ![](TrailBlueprint2.png)
1. Call the **EndTrails** function on the component. 
 ![](TrailBlueprint3.png)
1. You can also alter the trail's properties while it is running (the example below alters width each tick using the game time).  
 ![](TrailBlueprint4.png)

## Additional Notify Properties
In addition to the properties that can be modified in the **Anim Notify** section of the **Details** panel for each type of Notify (when applicable), the properties below can also be used to define how your Notify is used.

![](AdditionalProperties.png)

|---|---|
|[REGION:tablesection]Trigger Settings[/REGION]||
|**Notify Trigger Chance**| Defines the chance of triggering the Notify (0=No Chance, 1=Always Triggers).|
|**Trigger on Dedicated Server**| If disabled, this Notify will be skipped on Dedicated Servers.|
|**Notify Filter Type**| Defines a method for filtering notifies (stopping them from triggering). Can be set to filter by the meshes current LOD.|
|[REGION:tablesection]Event[/REGION]||
|**Trigger Weight Threshold**| Determines how much much weight the animation sequence needs to have to trigger the Notify. |
|**Montage Tick Type**| The method to determine how the Notify is handled, Queued or Branching Point (See [Montage Tick Type](#montageticktype) below). |
|[REGION:tablesection]Anim Link[/REGION]||
|**Slot**| The slot index currently being used within the LinkedMontage. |
|**Link Method**| The method used to calculate times, Absolute (stays at a specific time without moving), Relative (moves with its segment, but not when the segment changes size) or Proportional (moves with its segment and will stay at a certain proportion through the segment). |


### Montage Tick Type

The key difference between Queued and Branching Point settings for the Montage Tick Type is that Queued Notifies is asynchronous, while Branching Points are synchronous. What this means to the end user is that Branching Points come with a much higher degree of precision for where they will take place along the animation timeline.

High precision is important when you need to jump to a specific animation at a very precise moment in time. While you could use a Queued Notify to do the same job, the asynchronous nature of Queued Notifies means that the event could be fired at the incorrect animation frame, which can lead to hitches and jumps in your motion.

[REGION:warning]
Due to their synchronous nature and the precision resulting from it, Branching Points are more performance expensive than Queued. You should only use them when an event must be fired at a precise moment along the animation timeline, such as jumping directly to another animation that matches up frame-to-frame. If being off by a frame (or some percentage of one) is not important, you should use Queued instead.
