%Steps%

Before we can display a Widget in 3D world space, we must first create the [Widget Blueprint](Engine/UMG/UserGuide/WidgetBlueprints) we want to display. In this tutorial we are creating a 3D menu that players can navigate however you can take this approach to create any type of 3D widget you want to display (health bars, interactive in-world UI elements, etc.)

[REGION:note]
For this guide, we have created a new project using the **Blueprint Third Person** template with **Starter Content** enabled. 
[/REGION]


## Steps

1.  In the **Content Browser** of your project under the root **Content** folder, **Right-click** and create a new folder called **UMG**. 

1.	Inside the **UMG** folder, click **Add New** then under **User Interface**, select **Widget Blueprint**.

1.	Name the **Widget Blueprint** _MainMenu_ then click the **Save All** Button. 

	![](3DWidgets_2.png)

1.	**Double-click** on the **Widget Blueprint** to open it up in the UMG Editor.
	
	![](3DWidgets_3.png)

	You should default to the **Designer** tab of the Widget Blueprint. 
	
1.	In the **Hierarchy** window, delete the **CanvasPanel** then add a **Vertical Box** from the **Palette** window (found under the **Panel** section). 

	![](3DWidgets_4.png)

	You can **drag-and-drop** the **Vertical Box** onto the **Root** as shown in the image above. 

1.	In the **Palette** window under **Common**, drag a **Text** widget onto the **Vertical Box**. 

	![](3DWidgets_5.png)

1.	In the **Hierarchy** window, click the **Text** widget, then in the **Details** panel, set it to **Fill** and **Center** horizontally and vertically.

	![](3DWidgets_6.png)

1.	In the **Palette** window under **Common**, drag a **Button** widget onto the **Vertical Box**. 

	![](3DWidgets_7.png)

1.	In the **Hierarchy** window, click the **Button** widget, then in the **Details** panel, set **Size** to **Fill**. 

	![](3DWidgets_8.png)

1.	While in the **Details** panel for the **Button**, under **Style** and **Normal**, set the **Tint** to any color you wish (we selected Black). 

1.	Also expand **Hovered** and set the **Tint** color to something other than the color used for **Normal** above. 

	![](3DWidgets_9.png)

	This will set the button to appear one color when **Normal** and another color when the button is **Hovered** over with the mouse. 
	
1.	In the **Hierarchy** window, click the **Text Block** and copy it, then click the **Vertical Box** and paste it. 

1.	Repeat the previous step 2 more times so that there are 4 **Text Blocks**. 

	![](3DWidgets_10.png)

1.	In the **Hierarchy** window, click the **Button** and copy it, then click the **Vertical Box** and paste it. 

1.	Repeat the previous step so that there are 3 **Buttons**. 

	![](3DWidgets_11.png)

1.	Drag a **Text Block** on to each of the **Buttons** in the **Hierarchy**. 

	![](3DWidgets_12.png)

	Your layout should look similar to below in the graph.

	![](3DWidgets_13.png)

1.	In the **Hierarchy** window, click the top **Text Block** then in the **Details** panel under **Content**, set the **Text** to _MY GAME TITLE_.

1.	Also for the **Text Block** in the **Details** panel under **Appearance**, you can change the size of the Font under the **Font** option. 

	![](3DWidgets_14.png)

	Here we have given a header to the menu called **MY GAME TITLE** and set the size to **102**. 

1.	For each of the texts that appear on the buttons, change the text to the menu options you wish (also set their sizes). 

	![](3DWidgets_15.png)

	Here is our finished menu with **LOAD GAME**, **NEW GAME**, and **QUIT GAME** with font sizes set to **56**. 

1.	Click **Compile**, then click **Save** and close the Blueprint. 

## End Result

Our Widget Blueprint setup is complete and we can now use this as a **Widget Component** inside an Actor Blueprint which we will set up next. While we will not be hooking up functionality for the buttons when clicked, this will at least give us a menu that we can navigate in 3D world space which will respond to mouse interaction and will give you an idea on how to get started.
