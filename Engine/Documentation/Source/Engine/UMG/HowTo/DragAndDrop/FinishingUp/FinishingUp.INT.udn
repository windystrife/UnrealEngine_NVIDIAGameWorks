In this final step, we configure our **DragWidget** (which is the visual widget we are dragging). 
We then tell our Character Blueprint to add the **HUD** Widget Blueprint to the viewport as well as enable the Mouse Cursor so we can see where we are dragging. 

## Steps

1.	Open the **DragWidget** Widget Blueprint and replace the **Canvas Panel** with a **Size Box** with a child **Border**. 

1.	Rename the **SizeBox** to **WidgetSize** and set **isVariable** to true, then check both **Width Override** and **Height Override**.

	We are going to set the Width and Height of the Size Box to reflect the size of our Health Bar widget. 

1.	For the **Border**, set the **Brush Color** to **Black** with an **Alpha** of **0.5** for some transparency.

	In our example, we will have a silhouette of our Health Bar as the drag visual while keeping the actual Health Bar in the same location. 

1.	On the **Graph**, drag in **Widget Reference** then off **Event Construct**, cast to the **HealthBar** to get the **Desired Size** and **Break Vector**. 

	![](UpdateDragDrop5.png)

	This will give us the size of our Health Bar which we can then set our Size Box to. 
	We could have manually entered the overrides, however, if we change the size of our Health Bar we would then have to also change it here. 

1.	Drag in the **Widget Size** and off is **Set Height Override** and **Set Width Override** and connect as shown below.

	_Click for full view._
	
1.	In the **Content Browser** under **Content/ThirdPersonBP/Blueprints**, open the **ThirdPersonCharacter** Blueprint.

1.	Off an **Event Begin Play**, **Create Widget** (set to **HUD**) then **Add to Viewport** and **Get Player Controller** to **Show Mouse Cursor**.

1.	**Compile**, **Save** then click the **Play** button to play in the Editor. 


## End Result

When you play in the Editor, you can **Left-click** and drag the health bar on screen then drop it in a new location.

This is just an example of the elements you will need to start the Drag and Drop process. 
Additional checking may be needed to ensure that players do not drag the widget outside of Safe Zones or potentially on top of other widgets.
