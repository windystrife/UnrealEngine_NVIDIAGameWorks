Here we set up our main **HUD** Widget Blueprint and override what happens when we perform the **OnDrop** function. 

## Steps

1.	Open the **HUD** Widget Blueprint, then in the **Details** panel for the **Canvas Panel**, set its **Visibility** to **Visible**.

	We are doing our drag detection inside the Health Bar widget, however, when we release the Left Mouse Button we want to drop it in our HUD Widget Blueprint.
	In order for our HUD to receive hit detection, we need to set its **Visibility** setting to **Visible**. 

1.	From the **Palette** window, add the **Health Bar** widget to the graph in your desired location.

1.	Go to the **Graph** Mode, then add a **OnDrop** function override from the **My Blueprint** panel.

1.	Inside **OnDrop** drag off **Operation** and **Cast to WidgetDrag**, then **Get Widget Reference** and **Get Drag Offset**. 

	![](DragDrop16.png)

	We cast here to check which type of operation is being performed as part of the **OnDrop** function, is it **Widget Drag**? 
	If so, we get the **WidgetReference** (which we passed through as the widget being dragged) as well as the **DragOffset** (or position in which we started the drag from). 

1.	Off **My Geometry** and **Pointer Event**, use the **Absolute to Local** and **GetScreenSpacePosition** nodes and connect as shown.

	This will tell us the position in 2D space where we released the Left Mouse Button to drop the widget. 
	We will use this minus the **DragOffset** to determine where we should place the widget when it is dropped. 

1.	Subtract the **DragOffset** from the **Return Value** of **Absolute to Local**.

1.	Off **Widget Reference**, add a **Remove from Parent** followed by **Add to Viewport** and **Set Position in Viewport** nodes. 

1.	Connect the nodes as shown below and uncheck **Remove DPIScale** and check the **Return Value** on the **Return Node**.

	We uncheck **Remove DPIScale** and check the **Return Value** checkboxes as we do not need to remove the [](Engine/UMG/UserGuide/DPIScaling) and we have handled this function so we return as true. 
	With this script, we first remove the existing Health Bar widget before re-adding it to the screen in the new location relative to our Drag Offset. 

Our HUD is set up to handle dropping our dragged widget and it displays our Health Bar. 
In the next and final step in this tutorial, we set up our Dragged Widget to mimic the shape of our Health Bar as well as instruct our Character Blueprint to add the HUD to the viewport.
