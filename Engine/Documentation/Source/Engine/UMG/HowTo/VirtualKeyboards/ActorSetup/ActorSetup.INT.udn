%Steps%

In this final section, we add our Widget Blueprints as **Widget** Components to our Actors and define what happens when the player clicks on the **Enter** Button, checking to see if the entered text is the same as our **GoalText**. 
With everything in place, we give it a test to see the end result which prints **Success** to the screen if the code is correct or **Wrong Code** if the code is incorrect.  


## Steps

1.	Open the **KeypadDisplay** Blueprint and add a **Widget** component with class set to **KeypadDisplayWB** and **Draw at Desired Size**.

	Draw at Desired Size is a quick way to cause the render target to automatically match the desired size inside the Widget Blueprint.

1.	Open the **Keypad** Blueprint and add a **Widget** component with class set to **KeypadWB** and **Draw at Desired Size**. 

1.	Uncheck the **Window Focusable** option for this Widget Component. 

	![](Keypad16.png)

	We don't want this component to take focus away from the Keypad Display widget, so this needs to be unchecked. 

1.	Also inside **Keypad**, add a **WidgetInteraction** component with **Enable Hit Testing** set to false. 

	![](Keypad17.png) 

	We add this WidgetInteraction component so that we don't have to get a reference to the WidgetInteraction component in the player character and we disable Hit Testing as we don't want it to generate any hover effects. WidgetInteraction components by default are set to **Virtual User Index 0** when they are created and all of them communicate using the Virtual User Index ID. Since the WidgetInteraction component in the player character is also using Virtual User Index 0, this is the same as getting a reference to it.

1.	On the Graph of **Keypad**, off **Event Begin Play** take the **Widget** component and **Get User Widget Object** to **Cast to KeypadWB**.

1.	Off the **As Keypad WB** pin, **Set Widget Interaction** and pass through the **WidgetInteraction** component from Step 4. 

1.	Also off the **As Keypad WB** pin, call the **Assign Enter Pressed** which will create an **Enter Pressed** Custom Event.

	Now when we click on the Enter button this custom event will be called which we can use to check if the correct code was entered. 

1.	Create a **Variable** of the **Keypad Display** Actor type called **TargetDisplay** and set it to **Editable**.

1.	Create a **Variable** of the **Text** type called **GoalText**, then **Compile** and set the **Default Value** to **1212**. 

	![](Keypad21.png)

1.	Hold **Ctrl** and drag in **TargetDisplay** to get the **Widget** and **User Widget Object** then **Cast to KeypadDisplayWB**. 

	![](Keypad22.png)

1.	Off the **As Keypad Display WB** pin, get the **Editable Text Box** and **GetText(Text Box)** to see if it **Equals** **Goal Text**. 

	![](Keypad23.png)

1.	Add a **Branch** with two **Print Strings** where off **True** (use Success) and **False** (use Wrong Code). 

	![](Keypad24.png)

1.	Drag the **Keypad** and **KeypadDisplay** Blueprints into the level and rotate/position them as desired. 

1.	In the **Details** panel for the **Keypad** Actor, set the **Target Display** variable to the **KeypadDisplay** in the level. 

	![](Keypad25.png)

1.	Play in the level. 

## End Result

Approach the keypad display and **Right-click** in it to focus on it. You can look at the buttons and **Right-click** on them to issue the **Send Key Char** command and pass through the value to the display. 
We are using the Right Mouse button to interact with the widgets in the level, but you could swap this to use gamepad or Motion Controller button presses as well.

While this example only prints to the screen if the correct code was entered or not, you could instead fire off some event that opens a door, spawns an enemy or any other form of gameplay related event!
