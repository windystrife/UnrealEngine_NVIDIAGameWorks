First bit of business is to create the layout of our Main Menu which we will do below. 

1.	Open your **MainMenu** Widget Blueprint. 

1.	On the **Designer** tab, drag and drop widgets from the **Palette** onto the **Hierarchy** to achieve the setup below.

	For reference we have an **Image**, a **Vertical Box** with **Text** and 3 **Buttons** that have **Text** on our **Canvas Panel**. 

1.	Select the **Vertical Box** in the **Hierarchy** then **Right-click** and **Copy** it. 

1.	**Right-click** on the **Canvas Panel** and select **Paste** to paste a second copy of the **Vertical Box**.

1.	In the new **Vertical Box**, **Right-click** copy a **Button** and paste it to create a fourth Button/Text widget.

1.	Select the first **Vertical Box** and in the **Details** panel, rename it to **MainMenu**, check the **isVariable** option and set **ZOrder** to **1**. 

	![](Hierarchy4.png)

	We are naming the widget for clarity and setting it to a variable so that we can access it as well as setting the **ZOrder** so that it appears on top of our image which we will set in a moment. 

1.	Select the other **Vertical Box** and in the **Details** panel, rename it to **Options**, check the **isVariable** option and set **ZOrder** to **1**. 

1.	Rename each of the **Buttons** as shown in the image below. 

	![](Hierarchy5.png)

	By updating the names of our buttons so that we know what each one does, this will make it easier to script functionality for them. 

1.	Update each of the **Text** widgets as shown below via the **Text** section under **Content** in the **Details** panel. 

	![](Hierarchy6.png)

	Here we are updating the text that is displayed on each of the buttons as well as the menu headers. 

1.	Holding **Ctrl** select each of the **Buttons** then in the **Details** panel set a **Tint** color for **Hovered** and set each to **Fill** for **Size**. 

	![](Hierarchy7.png)

	Here we are adjusting the size of all of our buttons as well as defining a color for the button to take when mousing over it. 

1.	Select the **Image** in the **Hierarchy** then in the **Details** under **Appearance** and **Brush**, select a **Texture**, **Sprite**, or **Material** to use.

	[REGION:note]
	If you want to use the same one as this guide, you can download it from here: [Example Background](ExampleBackground.png)
	
	Drag-and-drop the Example Background into **Unreal Engine** to import it (click **Yes** at any confirmation messages). 
	[/REGION]

1.	In the **Designer** window, resize the image so that it takes up the entire layout.

	![](Hierarchy9.png)

1.	In the **Details** panel for the **Image**, click the **Anchor** button and choose the fill screen option. You can also use a Scalebox to hold the image, which will ensure that the image scales and resizes appropriately to match the aspect ratio.

	![](Hierarchy10.png)

1.	Select both **Vertical Boxes** and **Anchor** them to the left-center position. 

	![](Hierarchy11.png)

1.	Select the **Options** Vertical Box and set its **Visibility** setting to **Hidden**. 

	![](Hierarchy12.png)

	We do not want options to be shown by default, we will tell it to be visible through script. 

1.	Select the **MainMenu** Vertical Box and resize and position it as desired in the **Designer** window. 

	![](Hierarchy13.png)

1.	You can adjust the **Font**, **Size** and **Alignment** from the **Details** panel of each **Text** widget. 

	![](Hierarchy14.png)

	You can experiment with these settings to get your desired effect. 

1.	Setup your **Options** Vertical Box as desired then move it directly behind your **Main Menu** Vertical Box. 

	![](Hierarchy15.png)

	Since only one of these will be visible at a time, it is okay that they overlap one another. 

With the visual layout of our menu complete, in the next step we will script the menu's functionality.
