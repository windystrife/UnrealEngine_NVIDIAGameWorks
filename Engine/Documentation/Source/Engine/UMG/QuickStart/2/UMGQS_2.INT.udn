## Visual: Health, Energy and Ammo

Here we will begin setting up the visual aspects of our HUD. 

1.	Open your **HUD** Widget Blueprint to access the **Widget Blueprint Editor**. 

	![](Step2_6.png)(w:640)

	Inside the Widget Blueprint Editor we can provide the visual layout and scripted functionality of our HUD. 
	 
	[REGION:note]
	For more information on each of the different facets of the Widget Blueprint Editor, see [](Engine/UMG/UserGuide/WidgetBlueprints). 
	[/REGION]

1.	Inside the **Palette** window under **Panel**, drag a **Horizontal Box** onto the **CanvasPanel** in the **Hierarchy** window. 

	![](Step2_7.png)

	**Panel** Widgets are sort of like containers for other widgets and provide additional functionality for the widgets that are inside them.
	
1.	Also under **Panel**, drag two **Vertical Boxes** onto the **Horizontal Box**. 

	![](Step2_8.png)

1.	Under **Common**, drag two **Text** widgets onto the first Vertical Box and two **Progress Bars** onto the second Vertical Box. 

	![](Step2_9.png)

1.	Select the **Horizontal Box**, then in the graph resize the box and position it in the upper left corner of the window. 

	![](Step2_10.png)

	The progress bars will appear very small but don't worry, we will fix that next. 

1.	Select both **Progress Bars**, then in the **Details** panel set both to **Fill** for the **Size**. 

	![](Step2_11.png)

1.	Select the **Vertical Box** containing the Progress Bars and set it to **Fill** as well. 

	![](Step2_12.png)

1.	Select the **Horizontal Box** again and resize it so the bars line up with the text. 

	![](Step2_13.png)

1.	Select the top-most **Text** widget in the **Hierarchy** window then in the **Details** panel under **Content** enter **Health :**. 

	![](Step2_14.png)

	Do the same for the other **Text** widget but label it as **Energy** so your graph looks like below. 

	![](Step2_15.png)

1.	Select the **Progress Bar** next to health and in the **Details** panel set the **Fill Color and Opacity** to a green color. 

	![](UMGColorPicker1.jpg)(w:800)

	You may notice that Progress Bar does not change color when assigning a color. This is because the **Percent** value to fill the bar is set to 0.0 (you can change this to test out different colors, later we will link this to the health value of our character). 

1.	Also set a Fill Color for the **Energy** bar (we selected an Orange color). 
		
1.	For the display of Ammo, using the methods from above, add widgets to the **Hierarchy** so your setup is laid out like below. 

	![](Step2_16.png)

1.	With the **Horizontal Box** containing the ammo information selected, resize it and position it in upper right corner.

	![](Step2_17.png)

1.	With the **Horizontal Box** still selected, in the **Details** panel click **Anchors** and select the upper-right Anchor. 

	![](Step2_18.png)

	This will move the Anchor Medallion to the upper-right corner of your screen. 

	![](Step2_19.png)

	By **Anchoring** a Widget, you are indicating to the Widget that it is to appear in its placed position relative to the position of the Anchor Medallion regardless of screen size. In other words, when the screen size changes, move the widget the same distance away from the Anchor Medallion's position (in this example the same distance away from the upper-right corner of the screen). 

	[REGION:note]
	You can test different screen sizes by clicking and changing the **Preview Size** option inside the graph.

## Script: Health, Energy and Ammo

Now that we have our visual layout, we can add the hooks to provide the functionality behind our HUD elements. 

1.	Click the **Graph** button in the upper-right corner of the Widget Blueprint Editor window. 

	![](Step2_20.png)

1.	In the **Graph** under the **Event Construct** node, **Right-click** and add a **Get Player Character** node. 

1.  Drag off the **Return Value** pin and select **Cast to FirstPersonCharacter**

	![](Step2_21.png)

	Here we are checking if the Character Blueprint being used by the Player Character is indeed the **First Person Character** Blueprint. 

1.	Drag off the **As First Person Character** pin and select **Promote to Variable** (name it **My Character**) then connect as shown. 

	![](Step2_22.png)

	This will allow us to access the variables contained inside our **FirstPersonCharacter** Blueprint. 

1.  Click **Compile** in the toolbar to compile the script.

1.	Return to the **Designer** tab and select the **Progress Bar** next to **Health**. 

1.	In the **Details** panel under **Progress**, click the **Bind** option next to **Percent** and set it to use **Health** from **MyCharacter**. 

	![](HealthProgress.jpg)

	This binds the value of the Progress Bar to our **Health** variable inside our **First Person Character** Blueprint. Now whenever our Health value changes in our Character Blueprint it will automatically be updated in our HUD as well. You may also notice that the Progress Bar does not change after binding it. That is because we've stated this to occur upon **Event Construct** (or when the HUD is constructed, which occurs when the game is started).

1.	Select the **Progress Bar** next to Energy and repeat the process above, binding **Percent** to **Energy** from **MyCharacter**. 

	![](EnergyProgress.jpg)

1.	Select the 25 following the Ammo text, then in the **Details** panel for **Text**, click **Bind** and **Create Binding**. 

	![](CreateBinding.jpg)

	Now, like the way we previously used **Sub-Object Properties** to bind properties of the same type, we can also create our own custom bindings. Here we are going to bind our **Text** property to an **Integer** property from our **First Person Character** Blueprint giving us a display of our current Ammo.  

1.	Inside the function that is created and automatically opened, hold **Ctrl** and drag the **MyCharacter** variable into the graph. 

	![](Step2_27.png)(w:820)

1.	Drag off the pin **MyCharacter** and select get **Ammo**. 

1.  Connect the Ammo pin to the **Return Value** of the **Return Node**. 

	![](Step2_28.png)

	A conversion node **To Text** will automatically be created for you when connecting. 

1.	Repeat the process above for the other 25 text and creating a binding for the "Max Ammo" text. 

	![](Step2_29.png)

	You probably don't need to do this if your Max Ammo is going to remain the same, however this will allow you to change it. 

1.	Click **Compile** and **Save** then click the **Play** button to play in the editor.

	Our Health, Energy and Ammo values are now displayed on our HUD and reflect our current values from our Character Blueprint. Pressing **Space** will have the character jump and deplete Energy, pressing the **Left Mouse Button** will fire the weapon reducing our Ammo, and pressing **F** will cause us to lose Health (which you could hook up to a damage system at a later date). 
	
In the next section we will create a Main Menu which we can use to load into our game that we've setup.
