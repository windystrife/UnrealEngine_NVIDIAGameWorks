[REGION:note]
For this tutorial we are using the **Blueprint First Person** template with **Starter Content** enabled. If you do not know how to create a new project and use a template, please see the [](Engine/Basics/Projects/Browser) page for more information. 
[/REGION]

1. Click the **Add New** button inside the **Content Browser**, then under **User Interface** select **Widget Blueprint** and name it **HUD**.

	![](UMGQS1.png)

	All User Interface elements (HUD, Menus, etc.) will be created and housed inside a Widget Blueprint. The Widget Blueprint allows you to visually layout your UI elements as well as provides scripted functionality for those elements. We are creating this now so that we can tell it to be displayed when our player character spawns in the world, however we will set it up later. 
	
	[REGION:note]
	For more information on Widget Blueprints see the [Widget Blueprint](Engine/UMG/UserGuide/WidgetBlueprints) documentation. 
	[/REGION]

1. Create two more **Widget Blueprints**, one called **MainMenu** and another called **PauseMenu**. 

	![](AllWidgets.png)

1. **Right-click** in the **Content Browser** and create a new **Level** called **Main**. 

	![](CreateLevel.png)

	We will use this later in the guide for our Main Menu setup. 

1. In the **Content Browser**, open the **FirstPersonCharacter** Blueprint located under the **Content/FirstPersonBP/Blueprints** folder. 

	![](UMGQS2.png)

	This is the playable character's Blueprint in which we will create some information to pass to our **HUD** Widget Blueprint for display. 

1.	In the **My Blueprint** window, click the **Add Variable** Button. 

	![](UMGQS3.png)

1.	In the **Details** panel for the new variable, name it **Health**, change it to a **Float** variable type and set the **Default Value** to **1.0**. 

	![](UMGQS4.png)

	This variable will represent the player character's Health that we will display on the HUD. 

1.	Create another **Float** variable called **Energy** with a **Default Value** of **1.0**. 

	![](UMGQS5.png)

	This will represent the player character's Energy that we will display on the HUD. 

	[REGION:note]
	Unable to enter a Default Value? Click the **Compile** button from the Tool Bar to compile the Blueprint then try again. 
	[/REGION]

1.	Create another variable of the **Integer** type called **Ammo** with a **Default Value** of **25**. 

	![](UMGQS6.png)

1.	Create one more **Integer** variable called **MaxAmmo** also with a **Default Value** of **25**. 

1.	Inside the **Graph** window, **Right-click** and add an **Event Begin Play** node. 

1.	Drag off the **Event Begin play** then add a **Create Widget** node with **Class** set to your **HUD** Widget Blueprint. 

	![](UMGQS7.png)

1.	Off the **Return Value** of the **Create HUD_C Widget**, select **Promote to Variable** and name **HUD Reference**. 

	![](UMGQS8.png)

	This will create our HUD Widget Blueprint when the game is started and store it as a variable that we can access later. This is useful for calling functions or setting properties of the HUD later on, for example if you wanted to hide the HUD while the game is paused you can access the HUD through this variable. 

1.	Drag off the out pin of the **Set** node and add the **Add to Viewport** node. 

	![](UMGQS9.png)

	As the name suggests, this will add the Widget Blueprint specified as the target to the player's viewport, drawing it onscreen. 

## Adjusting Character Variables

The last thing we will do before we start generating our actual HUD is provide a way for our character variables to change. 

1. Inside the **FirstPersonCharacter** Blueprint, while holding **Alt** drag in the **Energy** variable and place it next to the Jump script. 

	![](Step2_1.png)(w:720)

1. Hold **Ctrl** and drag in a copy of the **Energy** variable and connect it to a **Float - Float** node set to **0.25** and connect as shown. 

	![](Step2_2.png)

	Each time the character jumps, 0.25 will be subtracted from the character's current Energy value. 

1. Set up the same script for the **Health** variable but use an **F** Key Event (or any other key press event) for testing.

	![](Step2_3.png)

	This will allow us to test that our Health variable is properly displayed through our HUD whenever a key is pressed. 

1.	Find the **Spawn Projectile** script and following the **InputAction Fire** event, **Right-click** and add a **Branch** node. 

1.	For the **Branch** condition, **Ctrl** drag in the **Ammo** variable connected to a **Integer > Integer** variable set to **0** and connect as shown.

	![](Step2_4.png)(w:820)

	This will only allow the player to fire a projectile if their ammo is greater than zero. 

1.	At the end of the **Spawn Projectile** script following the **Play Sound at Location** node, set **Ammo** to equal **Ammo - 1**. 

	![](Step2_5.png)

	This will subtract 1 ammo each time the player fires a projectile, giving us something to display on our HUD. 

1.	**Compile** and **Save** then close the Blueprint. 


In the next step we will set up the displaying of our Health, Energy and Ammo variables on our HUD and get them working in-game.
