The last thing we will do is create a simple Pause Menu which will allow the player to pause or exit the game. 


## Visual: Pause Menu Layout

In this section we will create the visual layout of our basic Pause Menu. 

1.	Open your **Pause Menu** Widget Blueprint. 

1.	On the **Designer** tab, drag and drop widgets from the **Palette** onto the **Hierarchy** to achieve the setup below. 

	![](Pause1.png)

	Here we have a **Border** that contains a **Vertical Box** with **Text** and two **Buttons** each with **Text** on our **Canvas Panel**. 

1.	In the **Designer** window, resize the **Border** so that it fills the entire dotted window (filling the screen). 

	![](Pause2.png)

	You can also change the color from the **Brush Color** option inside the **Details** panel. 

	![](Pause3.png)

	You may also want to set the set the **Alpha** for your color to **0.5** to give it some translucency. When the Pause Menu is opened during gameplay, the Border will fill the screen but adding some translucency will allow the game to still be visible in the background. 

1.	Also for the **Border** in the **Details** panel, be sure to use the fill screen Anchor. 

	![](Pause4.png)

	This will ensure that the Border fills the screen regardless of screen size. 

1.	Select the **Vertical Box** in the **Hierarchy** then in the **Details** panel, center it both horizontally and vertically. 

	![](Pause5.png)

1.	Select the **Text** under the **Vertical Box** then in the **Details** panel for **Content**, enter **Pause Menu**. 

	![](Pause6.png)

1.	Enter **Resume** and **Quit** for the other two **Text** blocks. 

	![](Pause7.png)

1.	Hold **Ctrl** and select both **Buttons** in the **Hierarchy**, then in the **Details** panel under **Style**, assign a color for **Hovered**. 

	![](Pause8.png)

1.	Rename the **Buttons** to **Resume** and **Quit** respectively inside the **Details** panel.

## Script: Pause Menu Functionality

With the visuals set, next we will provide the scripted functionality for our Pause Menu. 

1.	Click the **Graph** button in the upper-right corner of the Widget Blueprint Editor window. 

1.	On the **Graph** tab in the **My Blueprint** window, click the **QuitButton** then in the **Details** panel add an **OnClicked** Event. 

	![](PauseScript1.png)

1.	Also add an **OnClicked** Event for the **ResumeButton**. 

1.	In the **Graph** window, **Right-click** and add a **Get Player Controller** node. 

	![](PauseScript2.png)

1.	Off the **Get Player Controller**, use **Set Input Mode Game Only** then **Remove from Parent** and **Set Game Paused** as shown below. 

	![](PauseScript3.png)

	Here when the **Resume Button** is clicked, the input mode is set to game only and the cursor that is displayed when the Pause Menu is activated is removed. The **Remove from Parent** node is used to remove the actual Pause Menu widget from display before leaving the paused state by using the **Set Game Paused** node and leaving **Paused** unchecked. 

1.	Create a new **Function** called **Remove HUD**. 

	![](PauseScript4.png)

	We will use this to remove the game HUD from the player's view when the Pause Menu is activated. 

1.	In the Function, add a **Get Player Character** node and off the **Return Value**, add the **Cast ToFirstPersonCharacter** node. 

	![](PauseScript5.png)

	This will allow us to access the Character Blueprint being used by the player and the game HUD that is being used by that player. 

1.	Off the **As First Person Character**, use **Get HUD Reference** then **Remove from Parent** as shown below. 

	![](PauseScript6.png)(w:840)

	This will access the HUD being used by the player character and remove it from the viewport when quitting the game. 

1.	On the **Event Graph**, off **Get Player Controller** use the **Set Show Mouse Cursor** node set to **True**. 

	![](PauseScript7.png)(w:840)

	When **Quit** is clicked, this will turn on the mouse cursor for menu navigation when returning to the Main Menu. 

1.	Next add the **Remove HUD** function created above followed by **Open Level** (set to **Main** or the name of the Level that you have your MainMenu on) and connect as shown.

	Both Buttons are now setup, the last thing that we need to do is allow the player to call the Pause Menu and pause the game.  

1.	In the **Content Browser** under **Content/FirstPersonBP/Blueprints**, open the **FirstPersonCharacter** Blueprint. 

	![](PauseScript9.png)

1.	In the Graph, add a **M** Key Event and a **Create Widget** node (set to **Pause Menu**) and promote the **Return Value** to a variable. 

	![](PauseScript10.png)

	While we used the **M** Key as our input for bringing up the Pause Menu, you can use any key you wish. For the promoted variable, we called our variable **Pause Menu Reference** as this will store a reference to created Pause Menu. 

1.	Hold **Ctrl** and drag in the variable from the **MyBlueprint** window and connect it to an **IsValid** node. 

	![](PauseScript11.png)

	We are checking to see if the Pause Menu widget has been created and stored in this variable yet. 

1.	Connect the **Is Not Valid** pin to the **Create PauseMenu_C Widget**. 

	![](PauseScript12.png)

1.	**Right-click** and add the **Get Player Controller** node then **Set Input Mode UI Only** and connect the nodes as shown below. 

	![](PauseScript13.png)

	When **M** is pressed, if the Pause Menu has been accessed before it will not need to create it again and will instead access the variable. If this is the first time the Pause Menu has been accessed it will create it then store it as a variable so it can be access later. In either case, the input mode is set to UI only before we display the Pause Menu (which we will do next). 

1.	Off the **Pause Menu Reference** variable, use the **Add to Viewport** node then **Set Game Paused** (set **Paused** to **True**).

	[/REGION]
	
	_Click for full view._

	Our Pause Menu is setup, now it is time to test. 

1.	Click the **Compile** and **Save** Buttons, then the **Play** button to play in the editor.

	Once in-game, if you press the **M** Key (or whichever key you assigned), you will see that the game is paused and the Pause Menu appears. From here, you can resume gameplay with the **Resume** button or quit back to the Main Menu with the **Quit** Button. 
	

The next section will provide you with additional information on working with **Unreal Motion Graphics** and **Blueprints**.
