%Steps%

In this step we will begin placing [Actors](Engine/Actors) (which are things like lights or geometry for example) into our empty level. 
We will cover the two most common ways of adding Actors to the level, one of which is through [Place Mode](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Modes/PlaceMode) and the other is through the [Content Browser](Engine/Content/Browser). 
After completing this step, you will know how to place Actors inside your own levels and can begin manipulating those Actors to create your environment. 

## Steps

1. In the **Modes Panel**, with **Place Mode** enabled, click the [BSP](Engine/Actors/Brushes) category and select the **Box**.

1. **Left-click** and drag the **Box** into the **Level Viewport**. 

	![](placeBox.png)

	Upon releasing the **Left Mouse Button**, the **Box** will be added to the level.

1. With the **Box** still selected, in the [Details](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Details) panel (lower-right window of the editor), set **Location** and **Rotation** all to **0**. 

1. Set the **Scale** to **4 x 4 x 0.1**. 

	![](resize_floor.png)

	We will use this as the floor in which the player can walk around on. 

1. In the **Modes Panel** select the **Lights** tab, then drag-and-drop a **Directional Light** into the level on top of the floor.

1. On the on the [Translation Tool](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Viewports/ViewportControls), click and drag the Z-Axis (Blue) gizmo up away from the surface of the floor.

	If the **Directional Light** becomes unselected, you can re-select it by **Left-clicking** on it in the **Level Viewport**. 

1. In the **Modes Panel**, select the **Visual Effects** tab and drag-and-drop an [Atmospheric Fog](Engine/Actors/FogEffects/AtmosphericFog) to the level. 

	![](placeFog.png)
	
	The **Atmospheric Fog** Actor will add a basic sky to the level and the level will become illuminated instead of dark. 

1. From the **Modes Panel** on the **Basic** tab, drag-and-drop a [Player Start](Engine/Actors/PlayerStart) into the level. 

	![](placeStart.png)

1. From the **Modes Panel** on the **Volumes** tab, drag-and-drop a [Lightmass Importance Volume](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/Lightmass/Basics) into the level. 

	![](placeVolume.png)

	The **Lightmass Importance Volume** is used to control and concentrate lighting and shadowing affects within the volume. When placing the Lightmass Importance Volume in the level, the default size of the volume does not cover our playable area so we will need to scale it up. 
	
1. Inside the **Level Viewport**, press **R** to switch to the [Scale Tool](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Viewports/ViewportControls#transformcontrols). 

1. Click and drag the white box in the center of the **Scale Tool** so that the **Lightmass Importance Volume** encapsulates the floor. 

	![](scaleVolume.png)

1. Inside the **Content Browser** under **Content** > **StarterContent** > **Props**, drag-and-drop the **SM_TableRound** into the level. 

	![](placeTable.png)

	Try to place the table in the center of the floor using the **Move Tool** (Keyboard Shortcut **W** if it is not selected). 

1. Also under **Content** > **StarterContent** > **Props**, drag-and-drop the **SM_Chair** into the level. 

	![](addChair.png)

1. With the **SM_Chair** selected inside the **Level Viewport**, press **E** to access the [Rotation Tool](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Viewports/ViewportControls#transformcontrols). 
	
	![](Rotate1.png)(w:440)

1. **Left-click** and drag the **Blue** axis arc (the gizmo will update to show degrees) and rotate the chair to face the table. 

	![](Rotate2.png)(w:440)

1. Using the placement methods above, create a small scene by adding more Actors from the **Modes Panel** and **Content Browser**.  

	![](Engine/QuickStart/5/placeThings.png)

	Try adding some lights, props, walls and a roof (found under the **Content** > **StarterContent** > **Architecture** folder). 

## End Result

You should now have a Level that is populated with several different Actors types from both the **Modes** panel and **Content Browser**. You also have manipulated those Actors with the **Move**, **Rotate** and **Scale** tools. Depending on the Actors you placed in the final step, you should have something similar to above. 

In the next section, you will learn how to edit the Actors you have placed in the level and customize their properties.
