By now you may have noticed the "Preview" labels in the shadows and the light leaking under walls.

This is because all the lights in the scene are static and use precomputed, or baked lighting, which has not been calculated yet. The "Preview" text is there to remind you that what you are seeing in the viewport currently is not what you will see in the game. 

In this step we will go through the **Build** process which will build all levels (precompute lighting data and visibility data, generate any navigation networks and update all brush models). We will also take a look at **Light Quality** settings inside of the **Build Options** which we can use to adjust the quality of our lighting when it is built. 

## Steps

1. From the Main Tool Bar, click the down-arrow next to the **Build** option.

1.	Under **Lighting Quality**, choose the **Production** setting.

	This will give us the highest quality lighting but is the slowest in terms of computation time and will increase the time it takes to **Build** the game. Our level is small, so it should not impact us too much, but keep this in mind when you are working on larger levels as you may want to leave it on a mid-low level setting while creating your level and switching it to **Production** on a "final pass" at your level. 

1. Wait for the **Build** to complete.

	You will see the progress in the lower-right corner of the Unreal Editor as seen in the image above. 
	
	Once the **Build** process has completed, the level lighting will update giving you a better indication of the final result.

1. From the Main Toolbar, click the **Play** Button to play in the editor.

	Using **WASD** to move and the **Mouse** to turn the camera, you can fly around your level. 


## End Result

At this point you should have **Built** the level lighting and previewed your game with the **Play** in Editor feature. Each of the steps leading up to this point have been aimed at getting you quickly up to speed on how to perform the most common actions when constructing levels inside the Unreal Editor. 

In the next step, you will be given some examples of how you can take this sample level and build upon it using the methods that were provided throughout the course of this guide. Also, additional links to more detailed documentation related to the topics covered in this guide are provided which will serve as reference when constructing levels on your own.
