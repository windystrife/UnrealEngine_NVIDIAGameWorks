[TOC (start:2 end:3)]

The following requests will be made by the HTTP Streamer and must be handled by your replay server. In most cases, simply recording the information given in the appropriate location, or providing that information back to a viewer upon request, will be sufficient. It is good to note at this point that replays are not generally stored as a single file. Each individual chunk of a replay generally occupies its own file. Event data, although associated with a replay, is stored separately, since events can be searched without knowing what replay they belong to. Even event groups should be stored as separate files with lists of all events (across all replays) belonging to that group.

The HTTP Streamer's REST API provides functionality for streaming replays from the game server to the replay server (uploading), for streaming live or pre-recorded replays from the replay server to the game, or viewer, server (downloading), or for querying information about the replays available on the server (searching). To implement your own replay server, you will need to respond to the following HTTP requests, as well as any additional requests specific to your game.

## Upload Requests

### Start Streaming

Sends a request to begin uploading a replay stream.

#### Syntax

<!-- From StartStreaming(): -->

	<Server URL>replay/<Session Name Override>?app=<Replay Version AppString>&version=<Replay Network Version>&cl=<Replay CL>&friendlyName=<Platform Friendly Name>
	
#### Details

[REGION:simpletable]
| Item | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| Request Method | POST | 
| Content Type | application/json |
[/REGION]

#### Parameters

| Element | Value | Intended Use / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server URL | Replay server URL. Drawn from DefaultEngine.Ini, unmodified. | The final "/" in the URL must be included - it will not be added automatically. |
| Session Name Override | (Optional, including the leading "/".) Any name for the replay. Usually includes a GUID. | The replay server is expected to recognize this name when a replay is being requested. It should be returned as the session name, although it can be ignored and the streamer will respect the returned name. |
| Replay Version AppString | A user-defined string that describes the game being played. | This value is expected to be used for filtering when the HTTP Streamer requests a list of replays. |
| Replay Network Version | A user-defined string that describes the version of the game being played. | This value is also used for filtering lists of replays, so it should be stored with the replay data. |
| Replay CL | The changelist of the build being played. | This value is used for filtering lists of replays. |
| Platform Friendly Name | The platform on which the game is being played. | This value might be displayed to users, and is expected to be returned when lists of replays are requested. However, it will not be sent to the game server with requests for lists of replays and therefore is not expected to be used as a filter. |

#### Response

Expects a response of type `FNetworkReplayStartUploadingResponse`, which contains JSON data with the string "sessionId" defined. This value will be used as the **Session Name** in future communication from the HTTP Streamer. If the optional `<Session Name Override>` was provided, the returned "sessionId", and thus the ultimate `<Session Name>`, should be the same value. This is the game's way of demanding the session name.

| Name | Type | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Users | String Array | List of users present in the game. Should be stored as tags on the replay. |

### Upload Header

Sends a request to upload the binary data constituting the archive header, which should be recorded in a header file associated with **Session Name**.

#### Syntax

<!-- From UploadHeader(): -->

	<Server URL>replay/<Session Name>/file/replay.header?numChunks=<Stream Chunk Index>&time=<Total Demo Time In MS>
	
#### Details

[REGION:simpletable]
| Item | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| Request Method | POST | 
| Content Type | application/octet-stream |
[/REGION]

#### Parameters

| Element | Value | Intended Use / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server URL | Replay server URL. Drawn from DefaultEngine.Ini, unmodified. | The final "/" in the URL must be included - it will not be added automatically. |
| Session Name | Name of the replay being uploaded. | This name will match the value that the replay server provided in response to the initial upload request. |
| Stream Chunk Index | The index of the current chunk of replay data being sent. | Stream chunks are not uniform in size, but they are strictly ordered by this value. |
| Total Demo Time In MS | The total running time of the demo up to the end of the current stream chunk. | Tells how much replay data, in milliseconds, has been uploaded so far without having to interpret binary replay data. |

### Flush Stream

Sends a request to flush the stream. The content is binary replay data, which can be compressed. This data represents the chunk indicated by **Stream Chunk Index**. Since chunks can vary in data size as well as the length of time they cover, it is recommended that each chunk be stored in a separate file. The HTTP Streamer will attempt to flush its current stream data via this system every ten seconds. The interval between flushes can be adjusted by changing the console variable "httpReplay.ChunkUploadDelayInSeconds"

[REGION:note]
To enable compression, three functions must be overridden in a child class of `FHttpNetworkReplayStreamer`:

* `SupportsCompression` must return `true`.
* `CompressBuffer` must perform compression and return `true`, except in the case of an error.
* `DecompressBuffer` must perform decompression and return `true`, except in the case of an error.
[/REGION:note]

#### Syntax

<!-- From FlushStream(): -->

	<Server URL>replay/<Session Name>/file/stream.<Stream Chunk Index>?numChunks=<Total Chunks>&time=<Total Demo Time In MS>&mTime1=<Start Time In MS>&mTime2=<End Time In MS>&absSize=<Total Uploaded Bytes>

#### Details

[REGION:simpletable]
| Item | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| Request Method | POST | 
| Content Type | application/octet-stream |
[/REGION]

#### Parameters

| Element | Value | Intended Use / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server URL | Replay server URL. Drawn from DefaultEngine.Ini, unmodified. | The final "/" in the URL must be included - it will not be added automatically. |
| Session Name | Name of the replay being uploaded. | This name will match the value that the replay server provided in response to the initial upload request. |
| Stream Chunk Index | The index of the current chunk of replay data being sent. | Stream chunks are not uniform in size, but they are strictly ordered by this value. |
| Total Chunks | The total number of chunks sent so far. | This is always one greater than **Stream Chunk Index.** |
| Total Demo Time In MS | The total running time of the demo up to the end of the current stream chunk. | Tells how much replay data, in seconds, has been uploaded so far without having to interpret binary replay data. |
| Start Time In MS | The total running time as of the point where this stream chunk begins. | Time is in milliseconds. For streaming replays, can be used to identify which chunk a scrubbing viewer needs. |
| End Time In MS | The total running time as of the point where this stream chunk ends. | Time is in milliseconds. For streaming replays, can be used to identify which chunk a scrubbing viewer needs. |
| Total Uploaded Bytes | The total size of the demo up to the end of the current stream chunk. | Tells how much replay data, in bytes, has been uploaded so far. |

### Add/Update Event

Sends a request to add or update a replay event. Content contains binary event data to be recorded. This data can be sent through DemoNetDriver and is be user-defined. The second version of this HTTP request can be used to modify or update an existing event, whereas the first version is used to create a new event.

[REGION:note]
Note that events are meant to be stored separately from replays, which is why event names use GUIDs. Each event knows what replay it belongs to, which is why events are not embedded in the replays themselves.
[/REGION:note]

#### Syntax

<!-- From AddOrUpdateEvent(): -->

	<Server URL>replay/<Session Name>/event?group=<Group Name>&time1=<Event Time In MS>&time2=<Event Time In MS>&meta=<Meta Tag>&incrementSize=false
~~~
	<Server URL>replay/<Session Name>/event/<Session Name>_<Event Name>?group=<Group Name>&time1=<Event Time In MS>&time2=<Event Time In MS>&meta=<Meta Tag>&incrementSize=false

#### Details

#### Parameters

| Element | Value | Intended Use / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server URL | Replay server URL. Drawn from DefaultEngine.Ini, unmodified. | The final "/" in the URL must be included - it will not be added automatically. |
| Session Name | Name of the replay being uploaded. | This name will match the value that the replay server provided in response to the initial upload request. |
| Group Name | The name of the event group containing this event. | Events can be put into groups for filtering lists, such as grouping all penalty calls in a sports title. |
| Event Name | The GUID of the event being added or updated. | (Optional.) Information about specific, named events may be requested by viewers. If not specified, the event can still be found by listing the events in its group. |
| Event Time In MS | The time in the replay when this event takes place. | Time is in milliseconds. Although "time1" and "time2" can be used as a begin time and an end time respectively, they are always the same value in the default HTTP Streamer. |
| Meta Tag | Meta tag associated with this event. | Replay lists can be filtered by meta tag, if the request specifies any. **Meta Tag** will be URL-encoded by the HTTP Streamer during transmission. |

### Stop Streaming

Sends a request to indicate that the replay is done uploading.

#### Syntax

<!-- From StopUploading(): -->

	<Server URL>replay/<Session Name>/stopUploading?numChunks=<Total Num Chunks>&time=<Total Time In MS>&absSize=<Total Bytes Uploaded>

## Download Requests

### Request Start Download

The purpose of this request is to start downloading a replay from the replay server by establishing a connection based on the user name. Immediately after this request goes through successfully, the HTTP Streamer will send a request to download the replay's header, and then another to enumerate all checkpoints in the replay. 

#### Syntax

<!-- From StartStreaming(): -->

	<Server URL>replay/<Session Name>/startDownloading?user=<User Name>
			
#### Details

[REGION:simpletable]
| Item | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| Request Method | POST | 
| Content Type | None |
[/REGION]

#### Parameters

| Element | Value | Intended Use / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server URL | Replay server URL. Drawn from DefaultEngine.Ini, unmodified. | The final "/" in the URL must be included - it will not be added automatically. |
| Session Name | Name of the replay being downloaded. | This name will match the value that the server provided when the replay was originally uploaded. |
| User Name | Unique Net Id (GUID) | The preferred network GUID that is logged into the client machine. This value comes from the engine and is not intended to be user-supplied. |

#### Response

The expected response to this request is of type `FNetworkReplayStartDownloadingResponse`, which contains JSON data.

| Name | Type | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| State | String | The word "Live", to indicate that the game being viewed is happening live. Otherwise, the replay is assumed to be pre-recorded. |
| NumChunks | Integer | This is expected to be nonzero, and can be updated as streaming continues (used for live replays). |
| Time | Integer | The total time (in MS) of the replay. Subject to change if **State** indicated that this is a live stream. |
| ViewerId | String | A unique, name assigned by the replay server that the game server will use when requesting further chunks of replay data. Often referred to as **Viewer Name** in this document. |

### Request Header

#### Syntax

<!-- From DownloadHeader(): -->

	<Server URL>replay/<Session Name>/file/replay.header
				
#### Details

| Content Type | None |
[/REGION]

#### Parameters

| Element | Value | Intended Use / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server URL | Replay server URL. Drawn from DefaultEngine.Ini, unmodified. | The final "/" in the URL must be included - it will not be added automatically. |

[/REGION]

#### Parameters

| Element | Value | Intended Use / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server URL | Replay server URL. Drawn from DefaultEngine.Ini, unmodified. | The final "/" in the URL must be included - it will not be added automatically. |
| Session Name | Name of the replay being downloaded. | This name will match the value that the replay server provided when the replay was originally uploaded. |

#### Response

Expects a response of type `FHttpResponsePtr` containing checkpoint data as a JSON-formatted string.

| Name | Type | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| events | Array | Contains array entries which consist of all the other fields in this table. |
| id | String | The name (a GUID) of the checkpoint. |
| group | String | The group to which the event belongs, if any. |
| meta | String | Meta Tag string associated with this event, if any. |
| time1 | Integer | Start time (in MS) of the event. |
| time2 | Integer | End time (in MS) of the event. Often the same as the start time. |

[REGION:note]
Note that this is technically a generic request for a group of events. While "checkpoint" is explicitly specified here, the replay server should be able to handle other values for "group" and report all events for any given group.
[/REGION:note]

### Request Stream Chunk

This is a request for a specific stream chunk, named by the viewer. This request will not be sent while there is a chunk already being downloaded. 

#### Syntax

<!-- From ConditionallyDownloadNextChunk(): -->

	<Server URL>replay/<Session Name>/file/stream.<Stream Chunk Index>
					
#### Details

[REGION:simpletable]
| Item | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| Request Method | GET | 
| Content Type | None |
[/REGION]

#### Parameters

| Element | Value | Intended Use / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server URL | Replay server URL. Drawn from DefaultEngine.Ini, unmodified. | The final "/" in the URL must be included - it will not be added automatically. |
| Session Name | Name of the replay being downloaded. | This name will match the value that the replay server provided when the replay was originally uploaded. |
| Stream Chunk Index | The index of the current chunk of replay data being requested. | Stream chunks are not uniform in size, but they are strictly ordered by this value. |

#### Response

The expected response has a header with some information about the chunk, and its content is a binary chunk of replay data. The binary data can be compressed, if compression is supported. The following fields are expected in the header:

| Header Field Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| NumChunks | The total number of chunks in the stream. This can be useful with streamed games, as it lets the user know about new chunks that have been created while viewing. |
| Time | The total length of the replay (in MS). As with NumChunks, this value can change during the viewing session if the replay is live. |
| State | This variable has one recognized value, "Live". If this variable is missing or is a different value, the streamer will switch to non-live streaming mode. |
| MTime1 | The start time of the stream, in MS. Can be non-zero for live replay streams. This variable will only be checked if a chunk of data sent, and either this is the first chunk the streamer has downloaded, or the stream is live. |
| MTime2 | The end time of the stream, in MS. Can change as more chunks come in. This variable will always be checked if a chunk of data is sent, or if the replay is live. |

[REGION:note]
To enable compression, three functions must be overridden in a child class of `FHttpNetworkReplayStreamer`:

* `SupportsCompression` must return `true`.
* `CompressBuffer` must perform compression and return `true`, except in the case of an error.
* `DecompressBuffer` must perform decompression and return `true`, except in the case of an error.
[/REGION:note]

### Enumerate Events for Replay

Can be called directly from DemoNetDriver, meaning your game project can do this at any time. This request asks the replay server to send a list of all events pertaining to a specific replay (identified by **Session Name**) and filtered by a certain event group. It is recommended that empty group names, as well as a lack of the "group" argument, be supported. 

#### Syntax

<!-- From EnumerateEvents(): -->
	
	<Server URL>replay/<Session Name>/event?group=<Group Name>"
						
#### Details

[REGION:simpletable]
| Item | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| Request Method | GET | 
| Content Type | None |
[/REGION]

#### Response

Content received in response to this request is expected to be a JSON-formatted string corresponding to `FReplayEventList` and `FReplayEventListItem`.

| Name | Type | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| events | Array | Contains elements which consist of all the other fields in this table. |
| id | String | The name (a GUID) of the checkpoint. |
| group | String | The group to which the event belongs, if any. |
| meta | String | Meta Tag string associated with this event, if any. |
| time1 | Integer | Start time (in MS) of the event. |
| time2 | Integer | End time (in MS) of the event. Often the same as the start time. |

### Refresh Viewer

This request is a heartbeat, sent every ten seconds. This frequency is currently hard-coded, but will likely be made user-configurable without code changes in the future. If a viewer fails to send this request for a long period of time (perhaps one minute), then the viewer has most likely disconnected unexpectedly and it would be reasonable to disconnect them. If the "final=true" version is sent, the user is indicating that this is the final heartbeat, and the user has stopped watching the replay.

#### Syntax

<!-- From RefreshViewer(): -->
	
	<Server URL>replay/<Session Name>/viewer/<Viewer Name>
~~~
	<Server URL>replay/<Session Name>/viewer/<Viewer Name>?final=<Final Heartbeat>
							
#### Details

[REGION:simpletable]
| Item | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| Request Method | POST | 
| Content Type | None |
[/REGION]

#### Parameters

| Element | Value | Intended Use / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server URL | Replay server URL. Drawn from DefaultEngine.Ini, unmodified. | The final "/" in the URL must be included - it will not be added automatically. |
| Final Heartbeat | "true" or "false" | By default, "final" will not be sent unless **Final Heartbeat** is true. If true, the viewer has stopped watching and no further data should be sent. |

## Search Requests

### Search Replays

Request a list of all replays that the replay server can send. These replays are expected to be pre-filtered by the user's criteria in the URL. The replay server should be able to handle some of the filter fields being empty or missing.

#### Syntax

<!-- From EnumerateStreams(): -->

	<Server URL>replay?app=<Replay Version AppString>&cl=<Replay CL>&version=<Replay Network Version>&meta=<Meta Tag>&user=<User Name>&recent=<In Recent Viewer>"

| Replay CL | The changelist of the build being played. | This value is used for filtering lists of replays. |
| Replay Network Version | A user-defined string that describes the version of the game being played. | This value should reflect changes in your game's data formats as they affect replay. It is also used for filtering lists of replays. |
| Meta | Tags applied to this replay. | User-applied meta tags can be used for filtering games that have certain features. This could be anything from "all Capture The Flag matches" to to "games that went into double-overtime". |
| User | Unique Net Id (GUID) | This is used to filter games based on their inclusion of a specific player. |
| Recent | "true" or "false" | If true, only recently-uploaded replays should be shown. What defines "recent" is up to the replay server. |

| shouldKeep | Boolean | True if the debug "shouldKeep" request was made. |

### Search Replays by Event

Sends a request for a list of replays from the server. These replays are expected to be pre-filtered to include only those that contain at least one event in the named **Event Group**.

#### Syntax
