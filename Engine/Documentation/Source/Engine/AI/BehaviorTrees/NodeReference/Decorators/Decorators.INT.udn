version: 4.9

[TOC(start:2 end:2)]


**Decorator**, also known as conditionals in other Behavior Tree systems, are attached to either a [Composite](Engine/AI/BehaviorTrees/NodeReference/Composites) or a [Task](Engine/AI/BehaviorTrees/NodeReference/Tasks) node and define whether or not a branch in the tree, or even a single node, can be executed.

## Blackboard

![](Blackboard.png)

The Blackboard node will check to see if a value is set on the given Blackboard Key.

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Notify Observer** | [INCLUDE:#subprop2] |
| **Observer Aborts** | [INCLUDE:#subprop3] |
| **Key Query** | [INCLUDE:#subprop4] |
| **Blackboard Key**| The key to check. This is most useful for data types that can return `None` such as Objects, as other types may return their initialized values (0, false, {0,0,0}, etc...). |
| **Node Name** | The name the node should display in the Behavior Tree graph. |

<!--
[EXCERPT:subprop2]
| --- | --- |
| **On Result Change** | Reevaluate only when the condition has changed. |
| **On Value Change** | Reevaluate only when the observed Blackboard Key changes. |
[/EXCERPT:subprop2]

[EXCERPT:subprop3]
| --- | --- |
| **None** | Do not abort anything. |
| **Self** | Abort self, and any sub-trees running under this node. |
| **Lower Priority** | Abort any nodes to the right of this node. |
| **Both** | Abort self, any sub-trees running under me, and any nodes to the right of this node. |
[/EXCERPT:subprop3]

[EXCERPT:subprop4]
| --- | --- |
| **Is Set** | Is the value set? |
| **Is Not Set** | Is the value not set? |
[/EXCERPT:subprop4]

## Compare Blackboard Entries

![](CompareBBEntries.png)

The Compare Blackboard Entries nodes will compare the values of two Blackboard keys and will block or allow the execution of a node based on that result (either equal to or not equal to).

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Operator** | [INCLUDE:#subprop5] |
| **Blackboard Key A**| The first key to use in this comparison. |
| **Blackboard Key B**| The second key to use in this comparison. |
| **Observer Aborts** | [INCLUDE:#subprop3] |
| **Node Name** | The name the node should display in the Behavior Tree graph. |

<!--
[EXCERPT:subprop5]
| --- | --- |
| **Is Equal To** | Are the two keys equal to each other? |
| **Is Not Equal To** | Are the two keys different to each other? |
[/EXCERPT:subprop5]

## Composite

![](Composite.png)

The **Composite Decorator** node enables you to setup more advanced logic than the built in nodes but not as complex as a full Blueprint. Once you have added a Composite Decorator to a node, **Double-click** the Composite Decorator to bring up the Composite's Graph. By **Right-clicking** in the graph area you can add Decorator Nodes as stand alone nodes, then wire them together through **AND** nodes, **OR** nodes, and **NOT** nodes, to create more advanced logic:

## Conditional Loop

As long as the **Key Query** condition is met, this Decorator will have the node it's attached to loop.

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Node Name** | The name the node should display in the Behavior Tree graph. |

## Cone Check

![](ConeCheck.png)

The **Cone Check** decorator takes in 3 vector keys: the first for the location to start the cone, the second to define the direction the cone points, and the third for the location to check if it is inside the cone. You define the angle of the cone by using the **Cone Half Angle** property.

| **Node Name** | The name the node should display in the Behavior Tree graph. |

## Cooldown

![](Cooldown.png)

The **Cooldown** node will lock the execution of a node or branch until the cooldown time expires.

| -------- | ----------- |
| **Cool Down time** | The time, in seconds, the Cooldown decorator should lock execution of this node. |
| **Observer Aborts** | [INCLUDE:#subprop3] |

## Does Path Exist
