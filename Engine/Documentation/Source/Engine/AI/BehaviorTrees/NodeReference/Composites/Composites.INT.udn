Description:Reference for the Behavior Tree Composite nodes.
Availability:Public

[TOC(start:2 end:2)]

**Composite Nodes** define the root of a branch and the base rules for how that branch is executed. They can have [Decorators](Engine/AI/BehaviorTrees/NodeReference/Decorators) applied to them to modify entry into their branch or even cancel out mid execution. Also, they can have [Services](Engine/AI/BehaviorTrees/NodeReference/Services) attached to them that will only be active if the children of the Composite are being executed.

## Selector

![](Selector.png)

**Selector** Nodes execute their children from left to right, and will stop executing its children when one of their children succeeds. If a Selector's child succeeds, the Selector succeeds. If all the Selector's children fail, the Selector fails.

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Node Name** | The name the node should display in the Behavior Tree graph. |
	
## Sequence

![](Sequence.png)

**Sequence** Nodes execute their children from left to right, and will stop executing its children when one of their children fails. If a child fails, then the Sequence fails. If all the Sequence's children succeed, then the Sequence succeeds.

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Node Name** | The name the node should display in the Behavior Tree graph. |

## Simple Parallel

![](SimpleParallel.png)

The Simple Parallel node allows a single main task node to be executed along side of a full tree. When the main task finishes, the setting in **Finish Mode** dictates if the node should finish immediately, aborting the secondary tree, or if it should delay for the secondary tree to finish.

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Finish Mode** | [INCLUDE:#subprop1] |
| **Node Name** | The name the node should display in the Behavior Tree graph. |

<!--
[EXCERPT:subprop1]
| --- | --- |
| **Immediate** | Once the main task finishes, the background tree will be aborted.  |
| **Delayed** | The background tree will be permitted to finish once the main task has finished. |
