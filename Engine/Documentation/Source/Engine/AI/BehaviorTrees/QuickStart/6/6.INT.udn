Using the Top Down template gives us access to mouse controls to move our character around, but for the other character we are going to create, he will need his own controller. This AI Controller is going to set a few values on its Blackboard and is going to kick off the running of our Behavior Tree. For those familiar with Blueprints, here is what the final **Event Graph** will look like:

Below are the steps for creating the first part of the **Event Graph**. Step _7. AI Controller Blueprint: Initial Blackboard Values_ and Step _8. AI Controller Blueprint: Run the Behavior Tree_ also involve editing this graph.

## Steps

1. **Double-click** the AI Controller Blueprint in the **Content Browser** to begin editing it.
