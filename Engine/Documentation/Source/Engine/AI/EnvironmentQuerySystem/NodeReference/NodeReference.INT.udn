This is a quick reference for the Nodes and Tests available in the Environment Query Editor.

## Generators

### Actors of Class

Finds all of the Actors of a class within the **Search Radius** around the **Search Center**. The Actors are returned as the Items to be used in the tests.

![](gen_actor.png)(convert:false)

![](gen_actor_props.png)

[REGION:raw]
| Property | %spacer% | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- |
| **Search Radius** || The max distance to look for the desired Actors. |
| **Searched Actor Class** || The Class of the Actor to look for (Pawn, Character, etc...) |
| **Search Center** || The context to center the search on, such as from the Querier or perhaps some other context. |
[/REGION]

### On circle

Radiates traces out from the **Circle Center**, returning the hits on the edge of the radius (of the generated Circle) as Items.

![](gen_circle.png)(convert:false)

![](gen_circle_props.png)

[REGION:raw]
| Property | %spacer% | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- |
| **Circle Radius** || The radius of the circle that will expand out from the **Circle Center**. |
| **Space Between** || The space (in cm) between the items generated on the outer edge of the circle. |
| **Arc Direction** || This will enable the use of the **Arc Direction** feature which will enable you to focus the arc in a direction based either on a rotation of a context or the vector formed between to locations. |
| **Arc Angle** || The angle of the arc measured in degrees. |
| **Circle Center** || The context used as the center for the circle. |
| **Trace Data** || The type of trace to use. |
| **Projection Data** || If the resulting items should be projected onto the NavMesh (and which NavMesh data set to use). |
[/REGION]

### Pathing Grid

Like Grid, but this paths to different points on the NavMesh, only returning Items that are less than or equal to the **Max Distance** away.

![](gen_pathing.png)(convert:false)

![](gen_pathing_props.png)

[REGION:raw]
| Property | %spacer% | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- |
| **Max Distance** || How far to path away from the Querier. |
| **Distance Between** || The distance between the generated items. |
| **Path to Item** || Whether to path to or from the item. |
| **Generate Around** || The context to generate the pathing grid around. |
| **Navigation Filter** || The Navigation Filter to use.  | 
[/REGION]

### Simple Grid

Generates a grid of Items around the Querier.

![](gen_grid.png)(convert:false)

![](gen_grid_props.png)

[REGION:raw]
| Property | %spacer% | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- |
| **Grid Size** || The height and width of the grid of Items to generate. |
| **Space Between** || The distance between the grid Items. |
| **Generated Around** || The context used to Generate the Grid. |
| **Projected Data** || Should the grid be projected onto the NavMesh? This will move Items that may be inside walls or blocked, back onto the NavMesh, which can create bunching if a grid line happens to be just beyond the edge of the NavMesh. |
[/REGION]


## Tests

### Distance

This will return the direct distance between the Item and the chosen **Distance To**. If the Distance To is more than one location, it averages the results of each distance check.

![](test_dist.png)

[REGION:raw]
| Property | %spacer% | Description |
| --- | --- | :--- |

| **Distance To** || The Context that should be used to measure distance to. |
| **Test Purpose** || Should the test Filter, Score, or Filter and Score the result? Filtering will remove Items that fail the test, while scoring will weight an Item. |
| **Filter Type** || Change the type of filter to be a minimum, maximum, or range of values. Any values outside the values set in **Float Value Min** and/or **Float Value Max**, will be culled. |
| **Float Value Min** || Filter any value less than or equal to this value. |
| **Float Value Max** || Filter any value greater than or equal to this value. |
| **Clamping** || If a value isn't filtered, you can clamp it to limit a test's influence. Change the Clamp Min/Max Type properties to enable this. |
| **Clamp Min Type** || How should the lower bound for normalization of the raw test value before applying the scoring formula be determined? Should it use the lowest value found (rested), the lower threshold for filtering, or a separate specified normalization minimum. |
| **Clamp Max Type** || How should the upper bound for normalization of the raw test value before applying the scoring formula be determined? Should it use the highest value found (rested), the higher threshold for filtering, or a separate specified normalization maximum. |
| **Scoring Equation** || This modifies the score of the test to adhere to a curve. This can be a **Constant**, **Linear**, **Squared**, or **Inverse Linear** curve.  |
| **Scoring Factor** || The weight this test has among all the tests. Can be negative. |
[/REGION]

### Dot

Calculates the Dot Product of two vectors. These can be Context Rotations, or the vector from one point to another. Useful for figuring out if one thing is facing another.

| **Clamp Max Type** || How should the upper bound for normalization of the raw test value before applying the scoring formula be determined? Should it use the highest value found (rested), the higher threshold for filtering, or a separate specified normalization maximum. |
| **Scoring Equation** || This modifies the score of the test to adhere to a curve. This can be a **Constant**, **Linear**, **Squared**, or **Inverse Linear** curve.  |

### Random

Less of a test (though it can be used to randomly filter out Items), and more of a way to modify the weight of an item to add a bit of fuzz to what the AI decides. This generates a value from 0.0 to 1.0.

## Contexts

While not actually nodes, Contexts play an important part in how Environment Queries work, and are listed here for reference.

### EnvQueryContext_Item

**Items** are what are created by the Generator. At the most simple, if using the EQS Testing Pawn, they are the spheres that appear in the editor.

### EnvQueryContext_Querier

The **Querier** is the Pawn that is currently possessed by an AI Controller that is executing the Behavior Tree that has called on this Environment Query.
