In this example, we are using characters from the [Mixamo Animation Pack](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/mixamo-animation-pack), available for free on the Unreal Engine Marketplace. 
In the Mixamo Animation Pack, all the characters inherit from a general character Blueprint. Working in your own project, or with a 
C++ setup, you would need to adjust the following steps, but the primary concepts still apply.

Each character has their own value for a Dialogue Voice variable. Even if you don't localize your audio content, having a distinct voice per character
means that you can associate a given voice actor's recordings with that voice, so Zoe will always sound like Zoe. 


1. In the **MixamoAnimPack** folder in the **Content Browser**, **double-click** on **MixamoCharacter_Master** to open the Blueprint.

1. Add a new [variable](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Variables) to the Blueprint.

1. Name the new variable **DialogueVoice**, then set its type to a **DialogueVoice Reference**.

1. Compile and save your Blueprint.

	Now, we need to create the Dialogue Voice assets to use for each of our three characters.

1. Go back to the **Content Browser**, and create a new **Dialogue Voice** asset.

1. Name the new asset **QuestNPC**, then **double-click** to open it.

1. Referring to our design document, we know that the quest NPC's voice is **Feminine** and **Singular**. Use the drop-down menus to set the **Gender** and **Plurality** accordingly.

1. Repeat the process two more times to create a **Dialogue Voice** asset for Adam that is **Masculine** and **Singular**, and a **Dialogue Voice** asset for Zoe that is **Feminine** and **Singular**.

1. Save and close all your new **Dialogue Voice** assets.

Now that our **Dialogue Voices** have been created, we can associate them with our characters.

1. Back in the **Content Browser**, in the **Mixamo_SWAT** folder, open the **Mixamo_SWAT** Blueprint.

1. If your Blueprint is not a data-only Blueprint and the defaults are not already visible, click on the **Class Defaults** button in the **Toolbar** to open the Blueprint's default properties.

1. Set **Dialogue Voice** in the **Details** panel to **Quest NPC**.

1. Repeat the process to set the **Mixamo_Adam** Blueprint's **Dialogue Voice** to **Adam**, and to set the **Mixamo_Zoe** Blueprint's **Dialogue Voice** to **Zoe**.

1. Right-click on the **Dialogue Voice** asset in the **Content Browser**.
1. Select **Asset Actions >> Capture Thumbnail**.
