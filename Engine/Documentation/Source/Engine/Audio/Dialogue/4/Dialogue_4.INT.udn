Subtitles should be enabled by default, but if you need to check that they are on, there is a checkbox in **Project Settings**.

1. Open **Project Settings**.

1. Under **General Settings**, locate the **Subtitles** section, then make sure the **Subtitles Enabled** box is checked.

Now, when you trigger the Quest NPC's dialogue, the accompanying subtitle text shows at the bottom of the screen.
