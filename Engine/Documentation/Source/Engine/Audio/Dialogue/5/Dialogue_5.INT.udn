For a more complex conversation, you will likely want to use Sound Cues and Audio Components. Audio Components enable you to bind some functionality to when audio is finished playing, using the 
**On Audio Finished** delegate.  

[REGION:note]
One thing to consider, however, is that you cannot dynamically change the **Dialogue Context** when using Sound Cues, so your Blueprints or C++ logic will look 
different than the above example. 
[/REGION]

To play **Dialogue Waves** using **Sound Cues**, there is a **Dialogue Player** node in the **Sound Cue Editor**.

Select the **Dialogue Player** node and look at the **Details** panel. Here is where you can set the **Dialogue Wave** to use, as well as the **Speaker** and **Directed At** entries for the **Context**.

Here is some example Blueprint logic that shows how you could bind events to play the next piece of dialogue after the previous audio finishes playing.
