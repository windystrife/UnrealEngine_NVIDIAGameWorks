Below is a quick rundown of some of the Actors you will most commonly use or come across while developing games with 
Unreal Engine to familiarize you with what they are and why you would use them.

| [REGION:tablesection]Mesh & Geometry Actor Types[/REGION] |||
| **StaticMeshActor** | ![](Shared/Icons/Source/ActorIcons/StaticMesh_40x.png)(convert:false) | The **Static Mesh Actor** is a simple type of Actor that displays a mesh in the scene. Even though the name implies the Actor is static - or cannot move - the static part of the name refers to the type of mesh, a StaticMesh, that is used. These meshes are static in that their geometry does not change. The actual Actor can move or be modified in other ways during play, however. These Actors are generally used as world geometry and decorative meshes to create the environments of the level. See [](Engine/Actors/StaticMeshActor) for more detailed usage information. |
| **Brush** | ![](Shared/Icons/Source/ActorIcons/Brush_40x.png)(convert:false) | The **Brush Actor** is a basic type of Actor that displays simple 3D geometry in the scene. These Actors can be modified using the Geometry Editing mode in the Level Editor. BrushActors (or just Brushes) are commonly used for quickly prototyping environments and blocking out levels for testing gameplay. |
| **SkeletalMeshActor** | ![](Shared/Icons/Source/ActorIcons/SkeletalMesh_40x.png)(convert:false) | The **Skeletal Mesh Actor** is a type of Actor that displays an animated mesh, or a SkeletalMesh, whose geometry can be deformed - generally through the use of animation sequences created and exported from external 3D animation applications. These Actors are usually used for things like characters or other living creatures as well as complex machinery; anything that needs to deform or display other complex motion. These are also often used in conjunction with Matinee to create cinematic sequences |
| [REGION:tablesection]Gameplay Actor Types[/REGION] |||
| **PlayerStart** | ![](PlayerStart.png)(w:43) | A **Player Start** is an Actor that is placed in the level to designate where the player should start out when the game begins. |
| **Triggers** | ![](BoxTrigger.png)(w:43) ![](CapsuleTrigger.png)(w:43) ![](SphereTrigger.png)(w:43) | [INCLUDE:Engine/Actors/Triggers#intro] [INCLUDE:#trigger] See [](Engine/Actors/Triggers) for more detailed usage info. |
| **MatineeActor** | ![](MatineeIcon.png)(w:43) | **Matinee Actors** enable you to animate the properties of Actors over time via the Matinee animation tool, to create either dynamic gameplay or cinematic in-game sequences. The system is based on the use of specialized animation tracks in which you can place keyframes to set the values of certain properties of the Actors in the level. The Matinee animation tool is similar to the non-linear editors used for video editing, making it familiar to video professionals. See [](Engine/Matinee) for more detailed usage information. |
| [REGION:tablesection]Light Actor Types[/REGION] |||
| **PointLight** | ![](Shared/Icons/Source/icon_class_PointLight_40px.png)(convert:false) | [INCLUDE:Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/LightTypes/Point#intro] |
| **SpotLight** | ![](SpotLight.png)(w:43) | [INCLUDE:Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/LightTypes/Spot#intro] |
| **DirectionalLight** | ![](Shared/Icons/Source/icon_class_DirectionalLight_40px.png)(convert:false) | [INCLUDE:Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/LightTypes/Directional#intro] |
| [REGION:tablesection]Effects Actor Types[/REGION] |||
| **ParticleEmitter** | ![](Shared/Icons/Source/ActorIcons/Emitter_40x.png)(convert:false) | A **Particle Emitter** is an Actor that is used to create effects such as smoke, fire, sparks, and more by spawning particles in the form of sprites (camera-facing planes) or meshes. The actual behavior of the particles is defined in and controlled by special assets called [Particle Systems](Engine/Rendering/ParticleSystems) which are created in the [Content Browser](Engine/Content/Browser) and edited in the [Cascade Particle Editor](Engine/Rendering/ParticleSystems/Cascade) |
| [REGION:tablesection]Sound Actor Types[/REGION] |||
| **AmbientSound**  | ![](Shared/Icons/Source/icon_class_AmbientSound_40px.png)(convert:false) | **Ambient Sound Actors** are used to play sounds - in the form of Sound Cues - within the world. These sounds can be looping or non-looping and have spatialization and attenuation, though all of this must be set up in the SoundCue and is not exposed on the Ambient Sound Actor itself. |
