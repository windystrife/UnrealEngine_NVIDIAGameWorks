[EXCERPT:intro]
NVIDIA's Ansel technology makes it simple for PC gamers to capture and share enhanced images from their games. Integrating the Ansel UE4 plugin into your game is quick and easy.

An end-user overview of Ansel is available on [NVIDIA's Ansel Site](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/ansel).

The Ansel features available in Unreal Engine 4 are:

* **Free Camera** - Position the camera for ideal composition before taking a picture
* **Super Resolution** - Render at higher than game resolution for ultimate quality 
* **Post Processing** - Apply filters to alter the mood 
* **360 Capture** - Capture 360 panoramic images that can be viewed on PC or with a VR headset

| **360** | [REGION:lightbox][![](capture_360.jpg)(w:320)](capture_360.jpg)[/REGION] | A 360 degree view screenshot using a configurable resolution |
| **Stereo** | [REGION:lightbox][![](capture_stereo.jpg)(w:320)](capture_stereo.jpg)[/REGION] | A stereo screenshot using the current viewport resolution for each viewpoint |
| **360 Stereo** | [REGION:lightbox][![](capture_360stereo.jpg)(w:320)](capture_360stereo.jpg)[/REGION] | A 360 degree view stereo screenshot using a configurable resolution  |

To select a capture type, use the **Capture type** slider:

[REGION:note]
Not all filters are valid with multipart Capture types, e.g. 360 and Highres. You may therefore see filters, or aspects of a filter, removed in the final picture.

Similarly, not all UE4 postprocessing effects are valid with multipart Capture types.  Standard UE4 postprocessing effects which are problematic in this case are automatically removed in the final picture.

## Filters

A number of filters can be applied to adjust the look of the scene.

## Customizing the Player Experience

The default Ansel plugin configuration is meant to provide a sane out-of-the-box experience for typical projects but for the best player experience it should be configured for your game's needs and potentially integrated with your game logic. See the [](Engine/Plugins/Ansel/Reference/ConsoleVariables) and [](Engine/Plugins/Ansel/Reference/BlueprintAPI) for information on the available options and logic hooks.
