[EXCERPT:LightCache001]
[**Lightmass**](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/Lightmass) generates lightmaps for indirect lighting on static objects, but dynamic objects like characters 
need a method of receiving indirect lighting as well. This is solved by the **Indirect Lighting Cache**, which 
uses samples generated by Lightmass at build-time to calculate the indirect lighting for dynamic objects at runtime.

In the images below, you can see the difference between the dynamic objects rendered with and without the contribution 
from the indirect lighting cache:

## How it works

[EXCERPT:LightCache002]
From a high level point of view:

*	Lightmass places lighting samples throughout the level and computes indirect lighting for them during a lighting build.
*	When it comes time to render a dynamic object, the **Indirect Lighting Cache** checks to see if it already has available 
	lighting for that object and uses it if so.
*	If no lighting was available (the object is new or moved too much), the **Indirect Lighting Cache** interpolates lighting 
	from the precomputed lighting samples.


Lightmass places the lighting samples on top of upward facing surfaces with high density, and everywhere else with low 
density. The samples are limited to being within the _LightmassImportanceVolume_, and they are only placed on static surfaces.

The goal with this workflow is to require as little content setup as possible.  However, sometimes this placement heuristic 
gives insufficient detail in areas that are floating in space, for example an elevator that characters ride on or a flying 
section. You can place _LightmassCharacterIndirectDetailVolumes_ around those areas to get more detail.

At runtime, the **Indirect Lighting Cache** will interpolate the lighting samples to positions around each movable object.  A movable object is any component with Mobility set to Movable.  

Here the torus is a movable Static Mesh and the 5x5x5 interpolation positions are shown.

This interpolation only happens when the object moves enough to invalidate it, hence the cache naming.  Note that the positions 
are quite far from the object's bounds. This is to provide continuous and stable lighting as the object moves through the world. 
Most objects will effectively get 3x3x3 interpolation resolution.  The volume lighting samples store directional indirect lighting which allows normal maps to work.   

## Previewing Unbuilt Lighting

The Indirect Lighting Cache also allows previewing of objects with unbuilt lighting. It works pretty well for smaller objects, 
but not very well for large meshes like buildings or floors.  When you move a Static Mesh that had lighting built, it will automatically 
switch to the Indirect Lighting Cache until the next lighting build.

Here one of the pillars has been duplicated and it gets indirect lighting for previewing instead of being black.
