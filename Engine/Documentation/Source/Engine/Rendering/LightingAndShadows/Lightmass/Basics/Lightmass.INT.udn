## Building

1. Click **Build** ![](LI_Build.png) on the menu bar (you can use the little down triangle next to the build button and select **Build Lighting** if you so choose).

1. A dialog like this will appear at the bottom right of the screen.

1. Click **Keep** when it finishes.

And that is it. Depending on the number of lights, quality mode, the size of the level, what portions are contained within a Lightmass Importance Volume, and if other computers are available for the Swarm client to use, this process could take a few minutes or possibly substantially longer.

## Quality Modes

![](LMBuild_001.png)

These presets are about time versus quality. The **Preview** setting will render quickly and will give an ok representation of most baked direct lighting, while the **Production** setting renders more slowly, but gives a more realistic look while also correcting for various light bleed errors.

* **Production** - Looks awesome, takes a while.
* **High** - Looks good, takes some time.
* **Medium** - Looks better, takes a bit longer to calculate.
* **Preview** - Gets the point across, but at least it is fast.


These are just the presets, there are a vast number of settings that can be tweaked to get the desired lighting for your game. See the [**Lightmass**](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/Lightmass) documentation for more info on how to fine tune **Lightmass** settings.
