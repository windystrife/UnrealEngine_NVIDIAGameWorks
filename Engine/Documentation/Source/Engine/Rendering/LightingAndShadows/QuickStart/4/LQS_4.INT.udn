%Steps%

In this section, we are going to add a stylized light above our entryway by using a **Spot Light**. 

1. From the **Modes** menu under **Lights**, drag a **Spot Light** into the level.

1. In the **Details** panel for the Spot Light, set its **Transform** as shown below. 

	![](step4_2.png)

	This will place the light just above the entry doorway. 

1. Change the **Intensity** and **Light Color** (suggested values are shown below). 

	![](step4_3.png)

1. Adjust the cone shape of the Spot Light with the **Inner Cone Angle** (blue cone) and **Outer Cone Angle** (green cone). 

	![](step4_4.png)

1. Change the **Attenuation Radius** to affect its influence. 

	![](step4_5.png)

1.	Click the **Build** icon from the **Main Toolbar** to build the lighting. 

You can also use **Spot Lights** to provide additional ambient light. 

1.	With the **Spot Light** selected, in the viewport press **Ctrl+W** to duplicate it then set its settings as shown below. 

	![](step5_2.png)

	This will shine additional light into our apartment from the outside, let's make some additional changes. 

1.	Inside the **Details** panel for the new Spot Light, expand the additional settings button under **Light**. 

	![](step5_3.png)

1.	Uncheck the **Use Inverse Squared Falloff** option. 

	![](step5_4.png)

	This option affects the light falloff and most closely replicates the behavior of light in the real world. 

	[REGION:note]
	See the [Inverse Square Falloff](Resources/ContentExamples/Lighting/4_2) Content Example for more information. 
	[/REGION]

1.	Set the rest of the settings for the light as shown below. 

	![](step5_5.png)

	You may notice that we've elected to use a light blue color instead of the same color as our level lighting. 

	Doing this provides a contrast to our level lighting and creates a more naturally lit looking room.

We could have used a [**Sky Light**](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/LightTypes/SkyLight) instead of using a **Spot Light** for our extra ambient lighting. On a large scale area this might make more sense, however for our little apartment and to control the lighting more effectively, we used **Spot Lights** to create our ambient lighting. 

In the **Next Step** we will improve the quality of our lights and add reflective lighting to our apartment.
