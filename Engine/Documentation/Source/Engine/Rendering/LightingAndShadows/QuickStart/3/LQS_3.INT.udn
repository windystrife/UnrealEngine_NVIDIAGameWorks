1. In the **Details** panel for the light, change the light color and lower the **Intensity** of the light.

	The **Intensity** is one of the settings that can be used to adjust the brightness of the light. 

1. Select the **Attenuation Radius** field.

	Change the **Attenuation Radius** to 350.

	The influence range is reduced to cover our small bathroom better.
