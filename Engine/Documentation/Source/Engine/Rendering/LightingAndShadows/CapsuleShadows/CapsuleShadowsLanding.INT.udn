As of Unreal Engine 4.11 and later, **Capsule Shadows** can be used to enable support for soft shadow casting for Skeletal Meshes by using a capsule representation of your character made 
from a Physics Asset. The soft shadows serve to ground the character in indirectly lit areas and give soft shadows in directly lit areas.
