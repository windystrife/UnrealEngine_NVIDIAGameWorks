Now that you have created a sample Shadow Physics Asset for Capsule Shadowing, you can try some of the following on your own: 

* Try using different lighting angles, or time-of-day scenarios, for mid-day, dusk, or evening. 
* Adjust the **Light Source Angle** of your Directional Light to soften your Capsule Shadow in areas that are directly lit so that your character blends in with surrounding shadows. 
* Add some closed off areas with doorways and windows (or something similar) to a cave opening, to get contrasting light that gives directionality for the light source when **Capsule Indirect Shadow** is enabled.
* Use the setting for **Capsule Indirect Shadow Min Visibility** in your Character's Details panel to blend the soft shadow's intensity with your environment.
* Add some additional capsule bodies for the arms of your character for shadowing when it's near wall surfaces, like with a cover system, or if your character goes prone.
