Particle collision in your games can be limited when relying on Scene Depth, which can only use what is in the camera view. At some angles, collision isn't very accurate for particles that have longer lifetimes or that are
used over a large area. You can now use the **Collision Mode** for **Distance Field**, which enables your visual effects (VFX) to use whole scene collision using your Static Mesh's Distance Field representation. This collision
mode offers more reliable collision than Scene Depth, however, the [Global Distance Field](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/DistanceFieldAmbientOcclusion/#technicaldetails) is lower 
resolution, so you may find that particles pass through thin objects and sharp corners are rounded. Also, collision with Distance Fields is very efficient in that it costs about the same as using Scene Depth. 

In this guide, we'll look at how we can enable the **Collision Mode** in a Particle System to use **Distance Fields** over Scene Depth.

## Steps

[REGION:note]
This feature requires that **Generate Mesh Distance Fields** be enabled in your **Project Settings** in the **Rendering** section.

1. In your **Content Browser**, locate and open any **Particle System** or create a new one if you do not have one readily available.

	[REGION:note]
	For the purpose of this example, the **P_GPU_Particles_Collision2** asset from [Content Examples](Resources/ContentExamples) will be used for this demonstration.
	[/REGION]

1. Once **Cascade** (the Particle System Editor) opens, right-click in the empty space and from the module list, select **Type Data** > **New GPU Sprites**.

1. Now, right-click, again, in the empty space and from the module list, select **Collision** > **Collision(Scene Depth)**.

1. With the **Collision** module selected, navigate over to the **Details** panel and use the dropdown next to **Collision Mode** to use **Distance Field**.

	[REGION:note]
	Distance Field particle collision is a Shader Model 5 (SM5) feature, on hardware that doesn't support SM5, the particles will fall back to use Scene Depth Collision instead.

## End Result

Now that you've seen how to enable your Particle System(s) to use the Collision Mode for Distance Fields, your particles will be able to collide with the entire scene without relying on Scene Depth. This affords
you the flexibility in the types of effects and lifetimes of those effects that you create, whether they cover a large area or are a localized one.

In these examples, we'll take a look at how **Scene Depth** collision can have varying results depending on your camera view compared to **Distance Field** that doesn't rely on the camera view. This is especially noticeable
when moving under an enclosed area, like the tree in this example, where the parts out of view no longer provide collision for the area particle.
