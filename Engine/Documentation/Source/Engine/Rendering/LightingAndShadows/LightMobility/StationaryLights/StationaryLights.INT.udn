## Direct Lighting

The direct lighting of stationary lights is rendered dynamically using deferred shading. This allows 
the brightness and color to be changeable at runtime, along with a light function or IES profile. The 
light will have high quality analytical specular just like a movable light.  The direct lighting can 
be shown or hidden in game by modifying the **Visible** property of the light.

## Direct Shadowing

Realtime shadowing of light sources has a major performance cost. A fully dynamic light with shadows 
will often cost twenty times (20x) as much to render than a dynamic light without shadows. For this reason, 
stationary lights have the ability to have static shadowing on static objects, but with some limitations.

### Static Shadowing

#### On Opaque

[**Lightmass**](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/Lightmass) generates _distance field 
shadow maps_ for stationary lights on static objects during the lighting rebuild. Distance field shadow maps 
provide very accurate shadow transitions even at low resolutions, and with very little runtime cost. Like 
lightmaps, distance field shadow maps require uniquely unwrapped UVs on all _StaticMeshes_ using static 
lighting.

[REGION:note]
Lighting must be built to display distance field shadows, otherwise whole scene dynamic shadows 
will be used for previewing.
[/REGION]

Only 4 or fewer overlapping stationary lights can have static shadowing, because the lights must be assigned 
to different channels of a shadowmap texture. This is a graph coloring problem, so there are often fewer 
than 4 overlapping allowed due to topology. Shadowing cannot affect the overlap test, so **the sunlight 
typically requires a channel from the entire level it is in, even the underground areas.**  Once the channel 
limit is reached, additional stationary lights will use whole scene dynamic shadows at a severe performance 
cost. The **StationaryLightOverlap** view mode can be used to visualize the overlap, which is updated dynamically 
as you modify the lights. Light icons are changed to a red X when they are not able to allocate a channel.

[/REGION]

#### On Translucency

Translucency also receives shadowing very cheaply with Stationary lights - Lightmass precomputes a shadow depth map from static geometry which is applied to translucency at runtime.  This form of shadowing is fairly coarse and only captures shadowing on the scale of meters.

	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Translucency recieving static shadowing form a Diretional Light](1ShadowedCropped.png)(w:700)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

The resolution of the static shadow depth map is controlled by StaticShadowDepthMapTransitionSampleDistanceX and StaticShadowDepthMapTransitionSampleDistanceY in BaseLightmass.ini, with a default setting of 100 meaning one texel every meter.

### Dynamic Shadowing

[EXCERPT:StationaryShadows]
Dynamic objects (like _StaticMeshComponents_ and _SkeletalMeshComponents_ with Mobility set to Movable) must integrate into the static shadowing of the 
world from distance field shadowmaps. This is accomplished with _Per Object_ shadows. Each movable object creates 
two dynamic shadows from a stationary light: a shadow to handle the static world casting onto the object, and a 
shadow to handle the object casting onto the world. With this setup, the only shadowing cost for stationary 
lights comes from dynamic objects that it affects. This means the cost can vary from very little to a large 
amount, depending on how many dynamic objects there are. With enough dynamic objects, it is more efficient 
to use a Movable light instead.

In the scene below, the spheres are all movable, and they all receive shadows from the static world and 
cast their own shadows, which merge with the distance field shadows. The _Per Object_ shadow frustums for each 
Movable component are also shown.

[/REGION]

[REGION:note]
_Per Object_ shadows used by movable components apply a shadowmap to the object's bounds, therefore the bounds must be accurate.  For Skeletal meshes this means they should have a physics asset.  For particle systems, any fixed bounding box must be large enough to contain all particles.

#### Directional light dynamic shadowing

[EXCERPT:CascadedShadowMaps]
**Directional Stationary Lights** are special because they support whole scene shadows through _Cascaded Shadow Maps_ 
at the same time as static shadowing. This is very useful in levels with a lot of animating foliage; you want 
to have moving shadows around the player but do not want to pay the cost of having many cascades to cover a large 
view range. The dynamic shadows are faded into static shadows over distance, such that the transition is often 
indistinguishable. To set this up, just change the **Dynamic Shadow Distance StationaryLight** of a _DirectionalLightStationary_ to be the range at which you want the fade to happen.
[/EXCERPT:CascadedShadowMaps]

Movable components will still create PerObject shadows even when using Cascaded Shadow Maps on a directional light.  This behavior is useful with small Dynamic Shadow Distances, but incurs unnecessary cost with larger distances.  To disable PerObject shadows and save performance, disable *Use Inset Shadows For Movable Objects* on the light.

## Indirect Lighting

Stationary lights store their indirect lighting in the lightmap just like a static light. Indirect lighting cannot 
be modified at runtime by changing brightness and color like direct lighting can. This means that even when a 
light has **Visible** unchecked, its indirect lighting will be put in the lightmap during the lighting build. 
**IndirectLightingIntensity** on the light can be used to scale or disable the indirect lighting from a given light at lighting build time.  

However there's a post process volume setting called **IndirectLightingIntensity** which lets you scale the contribution of the lightmap for all lights, which can be changed at runtime from a blueprint. 


## Use Area Shadows for Stationary Lights
In the 4.9, or later, release of Unreal Engine, Stationary Directional Lights have a new shadowing option located in the Lightmass options called **Use Area Shadows for Stationary Lights**. 

![](Area_Shadows_Options.png)

To Enable the Use Area Shadows for Stationary Lights option, first select the **Directional Light** in your scene and make sure that it's **Mobility** is set to **Stationary**.
Then in the **Lightmass** section of the Directional light,  click on the box next the Use Area Shadows for Stationary Lights option to enable it. 
When the Use Area Shadows for Stationary Lights option is enabled, the Stationary Light will use area shadows for the precomputed shadow maps.
Area shadows are shadows that get softer the further they are from shadow casters.
In the following image you see the difference between the two shadowing methods.

	![Area Shadows Disabled](UniformPenumbraSharp.png)(w:900)

[/OBJECT]

_Note that Area Shadows will only work on Stationary Lights and you might have to increase some objects lightmap resolution to get the same shadow quality and sharpness._
