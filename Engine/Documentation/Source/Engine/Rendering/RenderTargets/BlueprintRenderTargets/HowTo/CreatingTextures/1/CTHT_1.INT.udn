In this section of the Creating Textures using Blueprints and Render Targets, we will go over creating a new level for our project to use.

## Create a New Empty Level

Creating a new **Empty Level** to place your Texture creation Blueprint in will make things easier to manage, ensuring that nothing else is affecting 
your Texture creation process. To create a new Empty Level inside of UE4, you will need to do the following:

1. From the **Main Toolbar**, go to **File** > **New Level**.

1. From the New Level window that is displayed, click on the **Empty Level** option.

1. After clicking on the **Empty Level** option, UE4 will load a new level that has nothing inside of it. Once that has happened, save the level by clicking on the **Save** button on the Main Toolbar, naming it `BlueprintTextureCreation`.

With the level now created and saved in the next section we will go over creating and setting up the required assets.
