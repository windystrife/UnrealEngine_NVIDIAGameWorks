Render targets are used quite extensively throughout Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) for a wide variety of different tasks. From storing the various buffers that are needed for a deferred renderer to helping display various complex effects like the ripples that happen when you throw an object into a pool of water, render targets can be leveraged to perform all kinds of interesting and useful effects.
