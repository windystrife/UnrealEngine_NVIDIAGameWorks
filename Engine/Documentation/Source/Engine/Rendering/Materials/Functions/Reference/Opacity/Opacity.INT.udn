Opacity functions exist to speed up handling of complex opacity calculations.

## Opacity Functions

The following is a list of all the functions underneath the Opacity category.

### SoftOpacity

The **SoftOpacity** function takes in an Opacity value and then runs a variety of calculations on it to give it a softer feel. It applies a Fresnel effect, and depth-based alpha, and pixel depth. The end result causes the object to fade away as the camera approaches it.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **DepthFadeDistance (Scalar)** | The depth at which objects have completely faded away. Only viable if using the *OutputUsesDepthBias* output.|
| **OpacityIn (Scalar)** | This is the incoming opacity value.|
| **FadeDistance (Scalar)** | How close you should get to the surface before it starts fading out. |
|[REGION:tablesection]Outputs[/REGION] ||
| **OutputUsesDepthBias** | This output causes the object to fade completely away to complete transparency by the time it reaches the distance set in the *DepthFadeDistance* input.|
| **OutputNoDepthBias** | This output causes the object to fade completely away as it reaches the camera, meaning there is no offset. This output is 12 instructions less expensive than *OutputUsesDepthBias*.|
