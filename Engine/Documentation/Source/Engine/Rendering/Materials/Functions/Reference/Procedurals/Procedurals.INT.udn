The **Procedural** functions provide a quick way to make simple procedurally generated textures and masks. This saves memory over having to use imported textures.

## Procedural Functions

The following is a list of all the functions underneath the Procedurals category.

### GeneratedBand

The **GeneratedBand** function generates a horizontal or vertical band from the default TextureCoordinates.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **Width (Scalar)** | A 0-1 value that calculates the width of the procedural band. The default is 0.25.|
| **Sharpness (Scalar)** | This controls the falloff of the band's edges. A setting of 100 will produce a very sharp band with aliasing.|
| **Offset (Scalar)** | This value will slide the band around the texture space.|
| **Direction Switch (StaticBool)** | Setting this to *true* will cause the band to be vertical instead of horizontal. Default is *false*, or horizontal.|
| **Compare (Scalar)** | This is the value the texture coordinate is compared against in order to produce the band. The default is 0.5.|
| **Input Coordinates (Vector2)** | Takes in a custom set of UVs rather than the default ones already built into the function.|

### GeneratedOffsetBands

Like the GeneratedBand function, **GeneratedOffsetBands** creates procedurally generated bands of texture across the UV space. However, this function can produce multiple bands instead of just one.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **Width (Scalar)** | A 0-1 value that calculates the width of the procedural band. The default is 0.25.|
| **Sharpness (Scalar)** | This controls the falloff of the band's edges. A setting of 100 will produce a very sharp band with aliasing.|
| **Offset (Scalar)** | This value will slide the band around the texture space.|
| **Direction Switch (StaticBool)** | Setting this to *true* will cause the band to be vertical instead of horizontal. Default is *false*, or horizontal.|
| **Compare (Scalar)** | This is the value the texture coordinate is compared against in order to produce the band. The default is 0.5.|
| **Bands (Scalar)** | This modifies the total number of bands.|
| **Input Coordinates (Vector2)** | Takes in a custom set of UVs rather than the default ones already built into the function.|

### NormalFromHeightmap

This function serves as a quick way to make a normal map out of an existing black and white heightmap, rather than having to load a separate texture into memory.

[REGION:note]
	This function takes in a TextureObject (T2d) expression node, rather than a TextureSample.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **Coordinates (Vector2)** | Takes in the coordinates for proper scaling/tiling of the heightmap.|
| **Height Bias (Scalar)** | This is the spread used to derive a proper height from the heightmap. Default value is 0.005.|
| **Height (Scalar)** | This controls the final strength of the normal map. Default is 8.|
| **Heightmap In (TextureObject)** | Takes in the heightmap texture from a TextureObject expression node.|

### NormalFromHeightmapChaos

The **NormalFromHeightMapChaos** function takes a heightmap and pans it in 4 directions, then blends the result back together to make a chaotically animated normal map.

[REGION:warning]
	This function is considered expensive and should be used with care.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **Coordinates (Vector2)** | Takes in the coordinates for proper scaling/tiling of the heightmap.|
| **Height Bias (Scalar)** | This is the spread used to derive a proper height from the heightmap. Default value is 0.005.|
| **Height (Scalar)** | This controls the final strength of the normal map. Default is 8.|

[REGION:note]
	At the time of this writing, there is currently no input for a heightmap. Such an input can be added using the steps below. However, if you see a heightmap input, then this has been corrected and the steps below are not needed.
[/REGION]

![Input correction](NormalFromHeightMapChaos_Correction.png)(w:900 h:600)

1. **Double-click** on the NormalFromHeightmapChaos function node to open it in a new Material Editor.

2. Locate the **Texture Object** (T2d) expression node. It should currently have the default (green slime) texture inside it.

3. Create a **FunctionInput** expression node and connect it to the *Texture (T2d)* inputs on the 3 *Motion_4WayChaos* function nodes.

4. In the properties for the new FunctionInput expression, set the **Input Type** property to *FunctionInput_Texture2D*.

5. Set the **Input Name** property to "Heightmap In" to label the input.

6. Connect the original *Texture Object (T2d)* expression node into the *Preview* input of the new FunctionInput expression node.
