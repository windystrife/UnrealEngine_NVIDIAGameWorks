In the following guide, we will enable Dbuffer Decals for our project so that we can take advantage of lighting features for our decal material and we'll create a basic 
Deferred Decal Material that can be applied to our Static Mesh.  

## Required Files

In order to follow along with this guide, you will need to download, extract, and then import to UE4 the following FBX and Texture files. If you are unfamiliar with how to do this please
check out [How to Import Static Meshes Guide](Engine/Content/ImportingContent/ImportingMeshes) and [How to Import Texture Guide](Engine/Content/ImportingContent/ImportingTextures) for more 
information about how to go about doing this.

## Enabling DBuffer Decals for your Project

1. In the **Edit** menu, click on **Project Settings** to view the Unreal Editor options.

1. Under the **Engine** heading, select the **Rendering** section and locate the **Lighting** category that contains various Lighting options.

	[/REGION]
1. Now, you can toggle the **DBuffer Decals** option to use lighting features with your Deferred Decals.

1. Before you'll be able to use this feature, you'll first need to **Restart the Editor**.

## Creating a Basic Deferred Decal

1. In the **Content Browser**, select the **Add New** button and choose the option for **Material** to create a new Material. Make sure you give your Material a name that will be easy to locate later.
For the purpose of this guide, I have named mine "M_MeshDecal."

1. Now, select your **Material** and double-click it to open it. Once the Material Editor opens, start by setting the following attributes in the **Details** panel so that it can be used as a Deferred Decal.

	* **Material Domain:** Deferred Decal
	* **Blend Mode:** Translucent
	* **Decal Blend Mode:** DBuffer Translucent Color, Normal, Roughness 

1. Next, you'll need to setup your material using the textures in the **Required Files** section of this page. There are three textures in the .zip file that we will need for this step; a diffuse, mask, and normal texture.
Once you've imported these textures, select them from the **Content Browser** and drag them into the Material Editor Graph.

	Now, plug in the outputs of the Texture Sample nodes into their corresponding inputs on the Main Material node. For the Mask texture,"T_MeshDecalDamage_M", be sure to use the **Blue Channel** output when
	plugging into the Opacity Mask input. This will make sure the blue values in the texture are used as the maskfor what should be visible.

1. Right-click in the Material Graph and type in "Constant" or hold down the "1" key and click in the graph to add a **Constant** value node. Plug this into your **Roughness** input and give it a default value of **0.7**. 

	![](MaterialGraph3.png)(w:400)
1. Before finishing up, we'll need a way to control the offset of the decal geometry from the base mesh to prevent or lessen any artifacts that can occur due to depth precision. Add the following nodes to your Material Graph
and plug the output of the **Multiply** node into the **World Position Offset** input of the Main Material node.

	Once you've done this, you're Material Graph should look similar to this:

	[![](FinalMaterialGraph.png)(w:400)](FinalMaterialGraph.png)
	[/REGION]
1. With your Deferred Decal Material complete, place the Static Mesh "SM_MeshDecal", which is included in the Required Files .zip, into your level and apply the Material **M_MeshDecal** to **Element 0**
of the Static Mesh's Material slots. For the Base Mesh's Material you can assign any material or even just a basic color to Element 1 for the purposes of this demonstration. You should now have something
that looks similar to our example below. 

		
## End Result

Now that you've set up and seen how to create your own Materials to use with a Mesh Decal, you should be confident in authoring your own assets in your modeling applications and creating your own Materials that take 
full advantage of lighting for use with Mesh Decals applied.
