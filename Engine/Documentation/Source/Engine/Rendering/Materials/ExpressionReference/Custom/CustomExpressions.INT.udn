## Custom

The **Custom** expression allows you to write custom HLSL shader code operating on an arbitrary amount of inputs and outputting the result of the operation.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Properties[/REGION] ||
| **Code** | Contains the shader code the expression will execute. (See [warnings](#Warnings) below) |
| **Output Type** | Specifies the type of the value output by the expression. |
| **Description** | Specifies the text to display in the title bar of the expression in the Material Editor. |
| **Inputs** | The array of inputs used by the expression. |

Add as many inputs as you need to the Inputs array, and name them. You can then write code in the Code property. You can type either a full function body with return statements as shown in the example, or a simple expression such as **Input.bgr**. You must also specify the output data type in OutputType.

Here is the code that was used above so you can try out the Custom node for yourself.

	float3 blur = Texture2DSample(Tex, TexSampler, UV);

	for (int i = 0; i < r; i++)
	{

	  blur += Texture2DSample(Tex, TexSampler, UV + float2(i * dist, 0));
	  blur += Texture2DSample(Tex, TexSampler, UV - float2(i * dist, 0));

	}

	for (int j = 0; j < r; j++)
	{ 

	  blur += Texture2DSample(Tex, TexSampler, UV + float2(0, j * dist));
	  blur += Texture2DSample(Tex, TexSampler, UV - float2(0, j * dist));

	}

	blur /= 2*(2*r)+1;
	return blur;

(#Warnings)
[REGION:warning]
**Using the custom node prevents constant folding and may use significantly more instructions than an equivalent version done with built in nodes!**  Constant folding is an optimization that UE4 employs under the hood to reduce shader instruction count when necessary.  For example, an expression chain of Time >Sin >Mul by parameter > Add to something' can and will be collapsed by UE4 into a single instruction, the final add.  This is possible because all of the inputs of that expression (Time, parameter) are constant for the whole draw call, they do not change per-pixel.  UE4 cannot collapse anything in a custom node, which can produce less efficient shaders than an equivalent version made out of existing nodes.  As a result, it is best to only use the custom node when it gives you access to functionality not possible with the existing nodes.

[REGION:warning]
**Shader code written in a custom node is compiled 'as is' for the target platform.**  This means that if the shader is being compiled for PC, it is assumed to be valid HLSL.  If compiling for PS3, it is assumed to be valid Cg.

## CustomTexture

The CustomTexture expression allows you to refer to a texture in the HLSL code inside a [Custom](#Custom) expression, typically to sample it inside the HLSL using the tex2D or similar function.

It is possible to use a regular TextureSample as input to a Custom node, but in that case the sample is being calculated outside the Custom node and the result passed in as a float4 value. This is not flexible enough for the case where you would like to sample the same texture multiple times in a loop, or to use other sampling instructions such as tex2Dbias, tex2Dlod, tex2Dproj (see HLSL documentation for the purpose of these).
