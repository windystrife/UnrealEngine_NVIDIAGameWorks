[EXCERPT:DepthFade]
## DepthFade

The **DepthFade** expression is used to hide unsightly seams that take place when translucent objects intersect with opaque ones. 

| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Properties[/REGION] ||
| **Fade Distance** | World space distance over which the fade should take place. This is used if the FadeDistance input is unconnected. | 
| [REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **Opacity** | Takes in the existing opacity for the object prior to the depth fade. |
| **FadeDistance** | World space distance over which the fade should take place. |

## PixelDepth

The **PixelDepth** expression outputs the depth, or distance from the camera, of the pixel currently being rendered.

In this example, the material network has been applied to the floor. Notice how the linear interpolation blends between the two colors as the floor recedes beyond 2048 units. A Power expression was used to boost the contrast between the two colors and yield a more meaningful visual result.

## SceneDepth

The **SceneDepth** expression outputs the existing scene depth.  This is similar to [PixelDepth](#PixelDepth), except that PixelDepth can sample the depth only at the pixel currently being drawn, whereas SceneDepth can sample depth at **any location**.

[REGION:warning]
	Only translucent materials may utilize SceneDepth.

| **UVs** | Takes in UV texture coordinates used to determine how the depth "texture" is sampled. |

In this example, we have applied the material network to a translucent sphere. Notice how the SceneDepth node is reading the pixels behind the sphere, rather than the ones on its surface.

[REGION:note]
**Programmers:** SceneDepth returns a raw depth value (integer from 0 to 2^24-1).  This non-linear depth can be normalized as follows:
      
    MaxZ = 16777215
	NormalizedDepth = 1 - MaxZ / (SceneDepth + MaxZ)

[/REGION]
--->
The resulting normalized depth is linear in the 0.0 to 1.0 range.
