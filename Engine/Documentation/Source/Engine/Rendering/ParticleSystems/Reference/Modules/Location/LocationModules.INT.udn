The **Initial Location** module is used to set the initial location of a particle at spawn time. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Location[/REGION]||
|**Start Location** | A vector distribution indicating the location the particle should be emitted, relative to the emitter. Value is retrieved based on the EmitterTime at the spawn of the particle.|
|**Distribute over NPoints**|When this is set to a non-zero number, it provides a number of evenly-spaced points along a uniform distribution from which to emit. For instance, if the min and max values of a distribution defined a line 100 units long, setting this value to 2 would cause particles to only be emitted from the actual min and max locations, nowhere in between.|
|**Distribute Threshold**|When _Distribute over NPoints_ is set to any non-zero number, this provides a percentage for how many of the particles will emit from those evenly-spaced points. For example, a value of 1 will cause all particles to emit from those points. A value of 0.5 would cause half of the particles to emit from those points, while the other half would still spawn randomly.|

In Spawn, the module retrieves the appropriate values from the distribution using the current emitter time. If the particle emitter does not have the _Use Local Space_ flag, this value is transformed into world-space. The Particle.Location field then has this value added to it.


## Initial Loc (Seed)

The **Initial Loc (Seeded)** module is identical to the [Initial Location](#InitialLocation) module in that it sets the initial location of a particle at spawn time; however, this module allows you to specify seed information to be used when choosing distribution values in order to provide a more consistent effect from the module each time the emitter is used. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]RandomSeed[/REGION]||
|**Random Seed Info** | The random seed(s) to use for selecting "random" values for this module's properties.[INCLUDE:Engine/Rendering/ParticleSystems/Reference#RandomSeedInfo]|
|[REGION:tablesection]Location[/REGION]||
|**Start Location** | A vector distribution indicating the location the particle should be emitted, relative to the emitter. Value is retrieved based on the EmitterTime at the spawn of the particle.|
|**Distribute over NPoints**|When this is set to a non-zero number, it provides a number of evenly-spaced points along a uniform distribution from which to emit. For instance, if the min and max values of a distribution defined a line 100 units long, setting this value to 2 would cause particles to only be emitted from the actual min and max locations, nowhere in between.|
|**Distribute Threshold**|When _Distribute over NPoints_ is set to any non-zero number, this provides a percentage for how many of the particles will emit from those evenly-spaced points. For example, a value of 1 will cause all particles to emit from those points. A value of 0.5 would cause half of the particles to emit from those points, while the other half would still spawn randomly.|




In Spawn, the module retrieves the appropriate values from the distribution using the current emitter time. If the particle emitter does not have the _Use Local Space_ flag, this value is transformed into world-space. The Particle.Location field then has this value added to it.


## World Offset

The **World Offset** module is used to offset the initial location of a particle. The offset is in world space but respects the _Use Local Space_ flag through the life of the particle. This means the particle will always spawn offset in world space regardless of the orientation of the emitter, but will keep that offset relative to the emitter throughout its life. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Location[/REGION]||
|**Start Location** | A vector distribution indicating the world-space offset the particle should use. Value is retrieved based on the EmitterTime at the spawn of the particle.|
|**Distribute over NPoints**|When this is set to a non-zero number, it provides a number of evenly-spaced points along a uniform distribution from which to emit. For instance, if the min and max values of a distribution defined a line 100 units long, setting this value to 2 would cause particles to only be emitted from the actual min and max locations, nowhere in between.|
|**Distribute Threshold**|When _Distribute over NPoints_ is set to any non-zero number, this provides a percentage for how many of the particles will emit from those evenly-spaced points. For example, a value of 1 will cause all particles to emit from those points. A value of 0.5 would cause half of the particles to emit from those points, while the other half would still spawn randomly.|

|**Update Position Each Frame** | If _true_, the locations of the particles will be updated to those of the bones or sockets each frame.|
|**Orient Mesh Emitters** | If _true_, mesh particles emitted by mesh emitters will be oriented to the bone or socket source.|
|**Skel Mesh Actor Param Name** | The name of the instance parameter specifying the SkeletalMeshActor that supplies the SkeletalMeshComponent to use in-game.|

## Direct Location

The **Direct Location** module is used to directly set the location of a particle. It contains the following member(s):

The offset will remain constant over the life of the particle.|

## Skeletal Mesh Vertex/Surface Location (Skel Vert/Surf Loc)

The **Skel Vert/Surf Loc** module allows for particles to be emitted from a skeletal mesh's vertices or polygonal surfaces. It provides the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Vert Surface[/REGION]||
|**Source Type** | Specifies whether the source locations are vertices or surfaces.[INCLUDE:#VertSourceType]|
|**Universal Offset** | The offset to apply to each bone or socket source.|
|**Update Position Each Frame** | If _true_, the locations of the particles will be updated to those of the vertices or surfaces each frame.|
|**Orient Mesh Emitters** | If _true_, mesh particles emitted by mesh emitters will be oriented to the vertex or surface source.|
|**Inherit Bone Velocity** | If _true_, particles inherit the associated bone velocities when spawned.|

|**Normal to Compare** | When _Enforce Normal Check_ is _true_, this will provide a normal direction to test against. |
|**Normal Check Tolerance Degree** |When _Enforce Normal Check_ is _true_, this gives a tolerance value against the _Normal to Compare_ value. A value of 0 means that the normals must match exactly, while a value of 180 would result in any normal direction being valid. |
|**Valid Material Indices** | Provides a list of materials applied to the skeletal mesh from which particles will be allowed to emit. Useful if only certain materials should be emitting particles. Leave empty to allow any material to emit. |
