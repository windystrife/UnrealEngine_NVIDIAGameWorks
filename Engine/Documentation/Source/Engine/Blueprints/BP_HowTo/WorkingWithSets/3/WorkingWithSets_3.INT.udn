By now, you should have a **TextRender** Actor displaying the contents of a Blueprint Set that you defined in the previous step. 
In this step, you're going to learn how to perform an **Intersection** of two Blueprint Sets, ultimately printing the result of 
the Intersection in the game's **Viewport**.

1.	From your project's **Content Browser**, double-click the **Display Set** TextRender Actor to open its Blueprint **Event Graph**.

	[/REGION]

1.	You should see the **Display Set** TextRender Actor Blueprint **Event Graph**, where you'll be able to add a new Blueprint Set to **Intersect** with the existing **Instruction Set**, ultimately displaying a resultant Set to the **Viewport**.

	[/REGION]

1.	At this point in the tutorial, you'll want to create a couple of Blueprint Set containers for the upcoming Intersection. Go ahead and right-click on the **Instruction Set** variable and select **Duplicate** from the drop-down list to create two new Blueprint Set variables, naming them `Shorter Instruction Set` and `Resultant Instruction Set`.

	[REGION:note]
	Performing an Intersection on two Sets (typically) involves a Resultant Set, which will contain only those items that are common to both Sets
	[/REGION]

1.	You should now have two new Blueprint Set variables, which you duplicated from the existing **Instruction Set** variable. You should also notice that if you select one of your new Blueprint Sets (for example, **Resultant Instruction Set**), the **Default Value** message, saying `Please compile the blueprint`, should be visible.

1.	Go ahead and click the **Compile** button.

	[REGION:caption]
		Click for full image.
	[/REGION]

1.	After compiling your Blueprint, you should see the **Default Value** message disappear, making way for some existing elements. As you know, you performed a duplication of the existing **Instruction Set** variable to create two new variables, thereby duplicating the elements that were originally contained in the original Blueprint Set into the newly created containers.  

	![](Step3_6.png)

	[REGION:note]
	Please note that you can create new variables without having to duplicate existing variables.
	[/REGION]

1.	To clear the **Resultant Instruction Set**, go ahead and click the **Removes all items** button located in the **Default Value** menu.

1.	Now, clear the items (or elements) from the **Shorter Instruction Set**.

1.	Before you can add new logic to the existing Blueprint Event Graph, go ahead and drag the **Shorter Instruction Set** and **Instruction Set** variables into the Blueprint.

## Scripting the Logic

1.	To get started with building your new logic, drag off the **Shorter Instruction Set** node and add the **Intersection** node from the **Set Utilities** interface.

	[/REGION]

1.	Now, connect the **Instruction Set** node to the **Intersection** node.

	[/REGION]

1.	Right-click in the Blueprint Graph to open the **Context Menu**, where you'll search for and add **Event ActorBeginOverlap**.

	[/REGION]
	
	[REGION:caption]
		Click for full image.
	[/REGION]

1.	Drag off the **Other Actor** pin of the **Event ActorBeginOverlap** node, search for, and add the **Cast To FirstPersonProjectile** node.

	[/REGION]
	
	[REGION:caption]
		Click for full image.
	[/REGION]

1.	Now, connect the **Cast To FirstPersonProjectile** node to the **Intersection** node.

	[/REGION]

	[/REGION]

	[REGION:note]
	Basically, this means that if the First Person Projectile successfully collides with this Actor's collision box, call the **Intersection** node.
	[/REGION]

1.	After the **Intersection** node performs its operation on the **Shorter Instruction Set** and the **Instruction Set**, you'll want to store the results in the **Resultant Instruction Set** container. To do this, go ahead and drag off the **Intersection** node and add the **Set Resultant Instruction Set**

		[![](Step3_15.png)(w:600)](Step3_15.png)
	[/REGION]

	[/REGION]

1.	Drag off the **Set Resultant Instruction Set** node and add the **To Array** node from the **Set Utilities** interface.

		[![](Step3_16.png)(w:600)](Step3_16.png)
	[/REGION]

	[/REGION]

1.	To iterate through the Array's elements, go ahead and drag off the **To Array** node and add the **ForEachLoop** node.

	[REGION:lightbox]
		[![](Step3_17.png)(w:600)](Step3_17.png)
	[/REGION]

	[/REGION]

1.	Connect the **To Array Node** with the **ForEachLoop** node.

	[/REGION]
	
	[REGION:caption]
		Click for full image.
	[/REGION]

1.	Now, you're ready to print the intersection's results to the **Viewport**. To do this, drag off the **Array Element** pin of the **ForEachLoop** node, search for, and add the **Print String** node.

	[REGION:lightbox]
		[![](Step3_19.png)(w:600)](Step3_19.png)
	[/REGION]

	[/REGION]

1.	Connect the **ForEachLoop** node to the **Print String** node.

	[/REGION]

1.	At this point, you're ready to determine what the **Resultant Instruction Set** will contain. Let's say, for this example, that you want the **Resultant Instruction Set** variable to only contain `Click`, `Left`, `Mouse`, and `Button`. The first thing you'll want to do, is to perform the intersection on paper: 

	| ------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
	| **Instruction Set** | **Shorter Instruction Set** | **Resultant Instruction Set (A &#x2229; B)** |
	| `Click`            | `Click`                     | `Click`                                     |
	| `the`              | `Left`                      | `Left`                                      |
	| `Left`             | `Mouse`                     | `Mouse`                                     |
	| `Mouse`            | `Button`                    | `Button`                                   |
	| `Button`           |                             |                                              |
	| `and`              |                             |                                              |
	| `Fire`             |                             |                                              |

	[REGION:note]
	As you can see from the paper-study you just performed, items common to both **Instruction Set** and **Shorter Instruction Set** are stored in the **Resultant Set** container. Whenever you're performing logical operations on Sets, it's good practice to perform the operation on paper (or a whiteboard) before scripting the logic into your Blueprint Graphs.
	[/REGION]

1.	Now that you know what items you want to store in the **Shorter Instruction Set** container, go ahead and select **Shorter Instruction Set** to inspect the container's contents.

	[REGION:note]
	As you can see from the highlighted image, **Shorter Instruction Set** is currently empty. At this time, if you were to perform an intersection of **Shorter Instruction Set** with **Instruction Set**, the **Resultant Instruction Set** container would be empty.
	[/REGION]

1.	Go ahead and fill the **Shorter Instruction Set** container with the following elements:

1.	After inspecting your completed script, go ahead and click the **Compile** button.

As you can see from the video, when a First Person Projectile collides with the **Display Set** collision box, the contents of **Resultant Instruction Set** are printed to the **Viewport**. 
Looking at the printed items, you'll notice that the items contained in **Resultant Instruction Set** are not in any predictable order, which is a property of Blueprint Sets. Check out the 
next step to learn how to perform a **Union** of two Blueprint Sets.
