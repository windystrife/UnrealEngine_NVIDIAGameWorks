More often than not, [](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Arrays) are the container-of-choice for most design scenarios. Arrays, being an ordered list of items where duplicates 
are allowed, offer developers a container that is both ordered and flexible. There are times though, when developers, working with pools of 
items, aren't worried with the order of each item belonging to the pools, rather, they might be concerned with the uniqueness of the items 
belonging to the pools that they're drawing data from. 

This is where a **Blueprint Set** might help.

## Goal

This guide teaches you how to set up and work with a Blueprint Set.

## Objectives

After working through this tutorial, you'll know the following: 

* How to create and edit Sets in the Blueprint scripting environment. 
* How to query and display items being contained in a Blueprint Set. 
* How to perform some basic operations on Blueprint Sets, including Intersections and Unions.
