* In the **FirstPersonCharacter** Blueprint, award a higher score for hitting the rock on the 1st versus 2nd or 3rd shot. 
* Also in the **FirstPersonCharacter** Blueprint, set it so the player cannot shoot unless a rock has been spawned. 
* In the level, add two more spawn points (perhaps at the corners, or on the left/right side of the player). 
* In the HUD, add a new category to keep track of the number of "first shot" hits by a player.
