%Steps%

In this step, we will allow our rock to be destroyed when it is hit by the projectile the player fires. To do this, we will use another **Bind Event**, but we are not going to bind it to an Event Dispatcher. Instead we will use a collision event called **OnHit** which fires off when the collision of our rock is hit by something which is perfect for our situation. 

Let's blow stuff up!

1.	Back inside the **FirstPersonCharacter** Blueprint, find the **Spawn Actor** node where we spawn our rock. 

1.	Drag off the **Return Value** of the **Spawn Actor** node and choose **Assign On Actor Hit**. 

	![](OnActorHit.png)

1.	Connect the **Spawn Actor** and **Bind Event**. 

1.	Off the **Return Value** of the **Spawn Actor**, choose **Apply Radius Damage (Destructible)**. 

	![](ApplyDamage.png)

	We could use **Apply Damage**, but would have additional parameters to enter. For simplicity we are going to use Radius Damage. 

1.	On the **Apply Radius Damage** node, enter in **50000** for each of the fields shown below and connect a **Get Actor Location** node. 

	![](EnterDamage.png)

	This will ensure we do enough damage to actually cause the rock to explode into pieces. 

1.	Following the **Apply Radius Damage** node, add a **Set Score** node. 

1.	Hold **Control** and drag in the **Score** variable and connect it to a **Int + Int** node (set to 1) and connect the nodes. 

	![](IncreaseScore.png)

	This will get the current score and add 1 to it each time a rock is hit. 

1.	Connect the **Bind Event** and **Set Score** nodes to a **Delay** node set to **3** seconds.

	![](DelayNode.png)

	After 3 seconds once the rock has been spawned (whether it was hit or not), we are going to destroy it. 

1. Following the **Delay** add a **Destroy Actor** node. 

	![](DestroyActor.png)

	Drag off the **Return Value** of the **Spawn Actor** node and feed it into the **Target** of the **Destroy Actor** node. 

1. Following the **Destroy Actor** node, add the **Set IsActive** variable node and leave it unchecked. 

	![](SetIsActive.png)

	We are now saying that the spawned rock is no longer active so the player can spawn another one (if they have enough pulls left). 

Our core gameplay is set up, if we were to play in the editor now you would see that you can show spawn, shoot and destroy a rock which is spawned from a random spawn point in the level. In the Next Step, we will communicate with our HUD and update the values displayed based on the values from the Character Blueprint.

Most of the communicating between **Blueprints** we have done so far has been passing information between one **Blueprint** and another. There may be times when you want to pass information between several **Blueprints** and not only that, between several different kinds of **Blueprints**. 

Below we will learn about the **Get All Actors of Class** node and how that can be used to pass information to several **Blueprints** of the same class at once. We will also take a look at an example of using **Blueprint Interfaces** which are a special type of **Blueprint** that act as an intermediary between **Blueprints** and can store/pass information between them. Any **Blueprint** that uses the interface can then have access to the data stored within it.

		Get All Actors of Class
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:description]
	Here we will use the **Get All Actors of Class** node to turn on several particle effects placed in the level all at once when the player is on fire. 
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

1. In the **Content Browser** under **Game/Blueprints**, open **Blueprint_Effect_Sparks** and go to the **Component** tab. 

1. In the **Details** panel for **Sparks**, uncheck **Auto Activate** under the **Activation** section. 

	![](BPHT5_1.png)

1. **Compile** and **Save** then close the Blueprint. 

1. Drag the **Blueprint_Effect_Sparks** into the **Level Viewport**. 

	![](BPHT5_2.png)(w:720)
		
1. With the effect selected, **Control+W** to duplicate it and place several in the level. 

	![](BPHT5_3.png)(w:720)

	_We placed them along the back wall so they show up better however you can place them where you wish._

1. In the **Game/Blueprints** folder, open the **MyCharacter** Blueprint and find the section of code where we set **isOnFire** to _true_. 

1. Drag off the **Set Is on Fire** node and add a **Get All Actors Of Class** node with **ActorClass** set to **Blueprint_Effect_Sparks**. 

1. Drag off the **Out Actors** pin and add a **ForEachLoop** node and connect the node. 

	![](BPHT5_4.png)(w:720)

	_Here we are saying find all the Actors of the **Blueprint_Effect_Sparks** class and for each of them, do something._

1. Drag off the **Array Element** pin and **Cast To Blueprint_Effect_Fire** and connect the node. 

1. Drag off the **As Blueprint Effect Sparks C** pin and **Get Sparks**, drag off **Sparks** and **Activate** it, and connect the nodes.

	[![](BPHT5_5.png)(w:720)](BPHT5_5.png)
	[/REGION]

	_Here we are stating the "something" we want to do which is to get the **Sparks** component from each and **Activate** them. Click image for full view._

1. **Compile** and **Save** then close the Blueprint. 

1. If you play in the editor now, when you catch on fire, all of the spark effects you placed should turn on. 

1. (Optional) Now that you have turned them on when you are on fire, add the same code but **Deactivate** the sparks when you are not on fire. 

This type of communication between **Blueprints** is useful if you want to make mass changes to several **Blueprints** across your level (say for example, turn on several lights or change their colors, despawn several items or change them in some way, etc.). The only drawback is that this applies to **Actors** of the same **Class** only. What if you wanted to turn on several lights, add particles and update a HUD or more? The next section will show you how you can accomplish just that by using **Blueprint Interfaces**. 

[OBJECT:TopicList]
	[PARAM:title]
		Blueprint Interfaces
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:description]
	Next we will have three different types of **Blueprints** react different when the player is or is not on fire. They will each need to know when that is, so we will use a **Blueprint Inteface** to tell them. 
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

1. In the **Content Browser**, click the **New** button and under **Blueprints**, select **Blueprint Interface**. 

	![](BPHT5_6.png)

1. Give the **Blueprint Interface** created a name such as **BP_Interface** then open the asset.  

1. Inside the **BP_Interface**, click the **Add Function** button then give the new function a name such as **PlayerCondition**. 

	![](BPHT5_7.png)

1. In the **Details** panel, click the **New** button under **Outputs** and give the **bool** created a name such as **getIsOnFire**. 

	![](BPHT5_8.png)

	_This will hold the value of the variable **isOnFire** in the **MyCharacter** Blueprint which will be set in a moment._

1. **Compile** and **Save** then close the Blueprint. 

1. From the **Game/Blueprints** folder, open the **MyCharacter** Blueprint. 

1. From the Toolbar, click the **Blueprint Props** button. 

	![](BPHT5_9.png)

1. In the **Details** panel under **Interfaces**, click the **Add** button and select the **BP_Interface**. 

	![](BPHT5_10.png)

1. This will add the **Interface** to this Blueprint and you will see it inside the **MyBlueprint** window. 

	![](BPHT5_11.png)

1. **Double-click** on the **PlayerCondition** function to open the graph. 

1. Hold **Control** and drag in the **isOnFire** variable and connect it to the **getIsOnFire** pin. 

	![](BPHT5_12.png)

	_This will now pass the value of the variable to the **Interface** so that any Blueprint using the **Interface** can get its value._

1. **Compile** and **Save** then close the Blueprint. 

1. In the **Game/Blueprints** folder, locate the **Blueprint_CeilingLight** and drag it into the level. 

	![](BPHT5_13.png)

	_Using the **Interface**, we will set the color of the light based on whether the player is on fire or not._

1. **Double-click** on the **Blueprint_CeilingLight** in the **Content Browser** to open it up. 

1. Click the **Blueprint Props** button from the Toolbar. 

1. In the **Details** panel, click the **Add** button and add the **BP_Interface**. 

	![](BPHT5_14.png)

1. **Right-click** anywhere in the graph and add an **Event Tick** node. 

1. Drag off the **Event Tick** and under **Interface Messages/BP Interface C**, select the **PlayerCondition** function. 

	![](BPHT5_15.png)

1. Connect a **Get Player Character** to the **Target** and a **Branch** to the **Get Is on Fire** out pin. 

	![](BPHT5_16.png)

1. Drag in the **Point Light 1** from the **MyBlueprint** window and connect it to a **Set Brightness** and **Set Light Color** node, and connect to the **False**. 

	![](BPHT5_17.png)

	_You can set the **New Brightness** to whatever you wish (1700 by default) and the **New Light Color** to a color to display when not on fire._

1. Copy the **Point Light 1**, **Set Brightness** and **Set Light Color** nodes and connect them to the **True**, changing their values to whatever you wish. 

	![](BPHT5_18.png)

	_Here we increase the **Brightness** to **5000** and set the light color to green instead of blue when the player is on fire._

1. **Compile** and **Save** then close the Blueprint. 

1. Open the **MyCharacter** Blueprint and delete the nodes we created in the previous section for the **Get All Actors Of Class** sequence and the sparks. 

	![](BPHT5_19.png)(w:820)

	_Delete each of the nodes above as we are going to use an **Interface** to turn them on/off._

1. In the **Game/Blueprints** folder, open the **Blueprint_Effect_Sparks** Blueprint. 

1. Click the **Blueprint Props** button, then in the **Details** panel, **Add** the **BP_Interface**. 

1. In the graph, implement the **PlayerCondition** function as we have done before and off the **Branch**, **Activate** and **Deactivate** the **Sparks**. 

	![](BPHT5_20.png)(w:820)

1. **Compile** and **Save** then close the Blueprint. 

1. In the **Content Browser**, locate and open the **GameHUD** Blueprint Widget we created. 

1. From the **Palette** window under **Common**, drag a **Text Block** onto the **CanvasPanel** in the **Hierarchy** window. 

1. Reposition/resize the **Text Block** on the graph and place it wherever you wish. 

1. In the **Details** panel for the **Text Block** under **Text**, enter something such as **You're On Fire**. 

	![](BPHT5_21.png)(w:640)

1. You can also choose where you want to **Anchor** the text. 

	![](BPHT5_22.png)

	_We have placed and anchored it to the center of the screen as well as resized and added color._

1. Also in the **Details** panel for the **Text Block**, change the name to **FireText** and check the **Is Variable** box. 

	![](BPHT5_23.png)

	_This will allow us to make modifications to the text during gameplay._

1. Click the **Graph** tab button in the upper right corner of the window. 

1. Click the **Blueprint Props** button, then in the **Details** panel, **Add** the **BP_Interface**. 

1. In the graph, implement the **PlayerCondition** function as we have done before. 

1. Off the **Branch** use the **Set Visibility** node, using the **In Visibility** drop-down to set **Visible** for **True** and **Hidden** for **False**.

	![](BPHT5_24.png)(w:820)

1. **Compile** and **Save** then close the Blueprint. 

1. Click the **Play** button to play in the editor. 

	![](GIF5.gif)(convert:false)

	_We have added a roof and more lights to illustrate the changing light colors but at this point you should see that the lights change color depending upon whether or not you are on fire. The sparks should also turn on/off and the "You're On Fire" text should appear/disappear whether or not you are on fire._ 

We have now seen how to communicate between two **Blueprints** using the **Cast To** node as well as how to communicate with several **Blueprints** of the same class (with the **Get All Actors of Class** node) and several **Blueprints** of different classes by using a **Blueprint Interface**. We also learned how to communicate with the **Level Blueprint** by using an **Event Dispatcher** to fire an **Event** as well as **Bind Events** for both **On Begin Play** and upon spawning. 

The next step in this guide will provide you with links to additional documentation on the topics covered for further reading and more explanation and examples.
