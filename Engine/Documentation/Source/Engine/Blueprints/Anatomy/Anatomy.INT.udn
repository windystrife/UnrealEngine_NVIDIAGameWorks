## Blueprint Classes

[INCLUDE:Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide\Types\ClassBlueprint#Intro]

[DIR(output:"listbutton" parent:"Engine/Blueprints/Anatomy" tags:"Class Blueprints")]


## Components

_Blueprints_ do not always need to contain scripted behavior. For example, a lightpost in your level may not be interactive, and would just need a mesh to represent the post and a light.
Using **Components** to build up reusable _Blueprints_ would accelerate your level design process. Of course, you could then work with those _Components_ in a graph to allow your players
to interact with the lights or have a time-of-day system adjust them accordingly. 

[DIR(output:"listbutton" parent:"Engine/Blueprints/Anatomy" tags:"Components")]

## Graphs

**Graphs** contain the design-time and game-time behavior of your _Blueprints_. The **Construction Script** runs following the Components list when an instance of a _Blueprint Class_ is created,
enabling you to dynamically adjust the look and feel of the new _Object_ or _Actor_. [INCLUDE:Shared/Glossary/E/#Glossary_EventGraph] 

[DIR(output:"listbutton" parent:"Engine/Blueprints/Anatomy" tags:"Graphs")]


## Organizing and Reusing Script

As you create more script in your _Blueprints_, you may find there are certain sections of script you frequently reuse. **Functions** and **Macros** both enable you to reuse sections of script,
although each method has different strengths and use cases. 
For more on the key differences between _Functions_ and _Macros_, see the [Blueprint Best Practices guide](Engine/Blueprints/BestPractices).

You can also collapse sections of your _Graph_ into nested _Graphs_ for organization.
