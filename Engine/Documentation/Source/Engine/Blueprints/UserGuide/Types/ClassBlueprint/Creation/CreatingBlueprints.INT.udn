##Creation via Class Viewer

When creating Blueprints via the [Class Viewer](Engine/UI/ClassViewer), it can be helpful to first filter the displayed classes to Blueprint bases only. 

1. In the **Class Viewer** toolbar, click on **Filters**.

	![](class_viewer_filters.png)

1. In the **Filters** menu, select **Blueprint Bases Only**.

	![](filter_blueprint_class_viewer.png)


Once you have filtered the list of classes, navigate to the class you would like to use as a base for your Blueprint. In the example here, we are creating a Blueprint with a **CameraActor** as a base.

1. Click on the down arrow icon to the right of your chosen class. 

	![](class_viewer_arrow.png)

1. The option to **Create Blueprint** will appear. Click on this, and the dialog for creating a Blueprint will appear.

	![](class_viewer_down_arrow.png)

1. Enter a name for your Blueprint, and select the folder where it should be saved.

1. Click on "Create [Path]/[Name]" at the top of the Blueprint creation dialog, and your Blueprint will be created and open in the **Blueprint Editor**.

1. To save your Blueprint in the Editor and complete the creation process, click on ![Save](blueprint_editor_save.png) in the **Blueprint Editor** toolbar.



You can also access Blueprint creation in the **Class Viewer** by **right-clicking** directly on the class you would like to use as a base for your Blueprint. 
The Blueprint creation process is the same as if you used the ![Down Arrow Icon](button_down_arrow.png) to the right of the class.

##Creation from a Selected Actor

1. Select the **Actor** (StaticMesh, Camera, etc.) that you would like to create a Blueprint from in the Unreal Editor.

1. In the **Details** pane, under Blueprint, click on the **Create (Type) Blueprint** button. 

	![](actor_details_create_blueprint.png)

	[REGION:note]
	You can also click on the **Replace With Composited Blueprint** button to add the Actor(s) to a new Blueprint and replace them in your level with the new Blueprint. 
	[/REGION]

1. Select the path where your Blueprint should be saved.
