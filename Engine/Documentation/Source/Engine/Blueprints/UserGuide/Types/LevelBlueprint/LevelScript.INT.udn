[EXCERPT:Intro]
A **Level Blueprint** is a specialized type of **Blueprint** that acts as a level-wide global event graph. 
Each level in your project has its own Level Blueprint created by default that can be edited within the Unreal Editor, however new Level Blueprints 
cannot be created through the editor interface. 

Events pertaining to the level as a whole, or specific instances of Actors within the level, are 
used to fire off sequences of actions in the form of Function Calls or Flow Control operations. 
Those familiar with Unreal Engine 3 should be very familiar with this concept as this is very similar 
to how Kismet worked in Unreal Engine 3. 

Level Blueprints also provide a control mechanism for level streaming and [Matinee](Engine/Matinee) as well 
as for binding events to Actors placed within the level.

For more information about the Level Blueprint UI, see [](Engine/Blueprints\Editor\UIBreakdowns\LevelBPUI).


## Default Level Blueprint

Each game can specify the default Level Blueprint class in the DefaultGame.ini config file. The Level Blueprints 
for all new maps will be created using this class allowing for game-specific additions and functionality.

## Opening a Level Blueprint

To open a Level Blueprint for editing, click the **Blueprints** button in the **Level Editor Toolbar** and select **Open Level Blueprint**.

This opens the Level Blueprint in the **Blueprint Editor**:

The **Blueprint Editor** only uses [Graph Editor](Engine/Blueprints/Editor/UIComponents/GraphEditor), **My Blueprints** panel, and **Details** panel. The **Class Defaults** panel using the **Class Defaults** ![](Engine\Blueprints\UserGuide\Variables\classDefaults_button.png) button on the menu bar.

## Referencing Actors

Often, you will need to connect a reference to an Actor to a **Target** pin on a node in your Level Blueprint. To get a node that contains an Actor reference:

1. Select the Actor in the **Level Viewport** or in the **World Outliner**.

1. Open the Level Blueprint.

	![Level Blueprint Button](toolbar_level_editor.png)

1. **Right-click** in the graph where you would like to add the node.
1. Select **Add Reference to [SelectedActor]** in the context menu that appears.

Alternatively:

1.  Drag and drop an Actor from the **World Outliner** tab into a graph in the Level Blueprint.

The Actor reference node that appears can be connected to any compatible **Target** pin.

In some cases, you will not need a reference node, as you can connect an output pin with the correct type to the **Target** input pin.

## Adding Events

There are two ways that [](Engine/Blueprints\UserGuide\Events) for a specific Actor can be added to a Level Blueprint. 

1. Select the Actor in the **Level Viewport** or the **World Outliner**.

	![](selected_actor.png)

1. In the **Details** tab, under the **Blueprint** heading, there is a **Level Blueprint Events** dropdown. Expand that menu, then select your desired event from the list.

Alternatively, once you have your Actor selected:

1. Open the Level Blueprint.

	![Level Blueprint Button](toolbar_level_editor.png)

1. **Right-click** in the graph where you would like to add the node.

1. In the context menu that appears, expand **Add Event for [ActorName]**.

1. Select your desired event from the list of events under **Add Event for [ActorName]**.
