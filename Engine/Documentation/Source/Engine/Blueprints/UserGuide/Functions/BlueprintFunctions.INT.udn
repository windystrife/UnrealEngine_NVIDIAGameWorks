[EXCERPT:Intro]
**Functions** are node graphs belonging to a particular **Blueprint** that can be executed, or called, from another 
graph within the Blueprint. Functions have a single entry point designated by a node with the name of the Function 
containing a single exec output pin. When the Function is called from another graph, the output exec pin is activated 
causing the connected network to execute.
[/EXCERPT:Intro]

[Blueprint Classes](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Types/ClassBlueprint), [Blueprint Interfaces](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Types/Interface) as well as the [Level Blueprint](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Types/LevelBlueprint) can all have any number of Functions contained within them that all serve different purposes, but are all created the same way through the [My Blueprint](Engine/Blueprints/Editor/UIComponents/MyBlueprint) tab in the **Blueprint Editor**.

[TOC (start:2 end:2)]

## Access Specifiers

[EXCERPT:AccessSpecifiers]
When creating Functions, you have the ability to specify what other objects can and cannot access those Functions. This is done by setting the **Access Specifier** property, which is available within the **Details** panel for any selected Function.

[REGION:raw]
![](AccessSpecifier.png)
[/REGION]

The property contains the following settings:

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Public** | A setting of Public means that any other object can call this Function. This is the default setting. |
| **Protected** | A setting of Protected means that the Function can only be called by the current Blueprint, as well as any Blueprints that derive from the current Blueprint. |
| **Private** | A setting of Private means that the Function can only be called from within the current Blueprint. |
[/EXCERPT:AccessSpecifiers]

(#PurevsImpure)
## Pure vs. Impure

[EXCERPT:PureVsImpure]
Functions can either be **Pure** or **Impure**. The main difference is that Pure Functions promise not to modify state or the 
members of the class in any way, while Impure Functions are free to modify state. Pure Functions are generally used for getter 
Functions or operators that just output a data value.

Impure Functions must be explicitly executed by connecting exec wires to [Function Call nodes](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Functions/FunctionCalls) in an [EventGraph](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/EventGraph). 
Impure Functions are designated using one of these methods:

* Specifying the **BlueprintCallable** keyword in the UFUNCTION declaration for UFUNCTIONs defined in code. 
* Leaving the **Pure** checkbox unchecked for Functions added through the **Blueprint Editor**.


Pure Functions are wired to Data Pins and are automatically executed by the compiler when the data relying on them is required. This 
means that a Pure Function will be called one time for each node it is connected to. Pure Functions are designated using one of these methods:

* Specifying the **BlueprintPure** keyword in the Function declaration for Functions defined in code.
* Checking the **Pure** checkbox for Functions added through the **Blueprint Editor**.
[/EXCERPT:PureVsImpure]

## Creating Functions

### Within A Blueprint

To create a Function inside a **Blueprint Class** or **Level Blueprint**:

1. In the **My Blueprint** tab create a new function, by clicking on the **Add Button** ![](Engine\Blueprints\Editor\UIComponents\MyBlueprint\plus_Button.png) on the functions list header ![](Engine\Blueprints\Editor\UIComponents\MyBlueprint\myblueprint_function.png).

1. Enter a name for your Function.

	[REGION:raw]
	![](name_function_blueprint.png)
	[/REGION]
	
Your Function will open in a new tab in the **Graph Editor** tab of the Blueprint Editor.

You can also create a Function by **Right-clicking** in the **My Blueprint** tab and selecting **Function**.

![](add_function_rtclick.png)

### In a Blueprint Interface

[EXCERPT:InterfaceFunction]
Functions created in a **Blueprint Interface** are created with the same method as Functions in a **Blueprint Class** or **Level Blueprint**, but the implementation is very different. 

To create a Function inside a **Blueprint Interface**:

1. In the **My Blueprint** tab create a new function, by clicking on the **Add Button** ![](Engine\Blueprints\Editor\UIComponents\MyBlueprint\plus_Button.png) on the functions list header ![](Engine\Blueprints\Editor\UIComponents\MyBlueprint\myblueprint_function.png).

1. Enter a name for your Function.

	![](name_function_interface.png)
	
Your Function will open in a new tab in the **Graph Editor** tab of the Blueprint Editor.

You can also create a Function by **Right-clicking** in the **My Blueprint** tab and selecting **Function**.

![](interface_function_rtclick.png)

[/EXCERPT:InterfaceFunction]

[REGION:note]
Functions in **Blueprint Interfaces** do not have graphs as they do not have implementations. The **Graph** opened when a 
new Function is created in a Blueprint Interface  will be empty except for the Function's input node, which is grayed out.
[/REGION]

## Editing Functions

Once a Function has been created, you then need to define its functionality. This is a two-step process:

* Create the necessary input and output parameters.
* Create a node network in between your input and output to define Function behavior.


You can set a **Description**, **Category**, **Access Specifier**, and whether or not the Function is **Pure** in the **Details** tab.

To open the **Details** tab for your Function, you can:

* Select your Function in the **My Blueprint** tab.
* Select the Function node in the graph where it is being called.
* Select the Function entry (or result) node in the Function's graph.

[REGION:raw]
![](selected_function_myblueprint.png)
[/REGION]


### Input and Output Parameters

You can set the input and output parameters in the **Details** tab for your Function as well.

To add input or output parameters:

1. Click on the **New** button in either the **Inputs** or **Outputs** section of the **Details** pane.

1. Name the new parameter and set its type using the dropdown menu. In this example, there are two vector data inputs named **VectorA** and **VectorB**, and a float data output called **Distance**. 
	
	[REGION:raw]
	![](function_details.png)
	[/REGION]

	[REGION:note]
	Unlike [Blueprint Macros](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Types/MacroLibrary), you can only add data inputs and outputs to Functions. 
	[/REGION]

	The entry and result nodes in the Function graph will automatically update with the correct pins, as will any Function call nodes.

	![](function_tunnel_with_pins.png)

	![](function_call_with_pins.png)

1. You can also set a default value by expanding the entry for the parameter, as well as select whether or not the value should be passed by reference.

	[REGION:raw]
	![](function_details_expanded.png)
	[/REGION]


To change the location of the pin for this parameter on the edge of the node, use the up and down arrows in the expanded **Details** pane entry.


Your Function is now ready to have its functionality defined. We will do this by creating a node network between the entry and result nodes.


### Defining Functionality

Your Function can be defined by creating a Blueprint graph that connects between the input and output nodes. In this example, we will have created the necessary network to apply the 3D version of the Pythagorean Theorem (illustrated below), returning the distance between 2 points in 3D space.

	dx = (x2-x1)^2
	dy = (y2-y1)^2
	dz = (z2-z1)^2

	D = sqrt(dx+dy+dz)

## Calling Functions

Once you have created and defined your Function, it is time to call it in your **EventGraph**. To create a node that will call your Function:

* Drag your Function from the **My Blueprint** tab to an empty spot in your EventGraph.

* **Right-click** in the EventGraph or drag from an appropriate execution or data pin to open the context menu. Search within the context menu for your Function, and then select it to add the Function call node.

The network below takes two vector variables, and on every tick, calculates the distance between them and prints the distance to the screen.

![](EventGraph.png)(w:700)

In this example, we have created 2 public vector variables. In the settings for each one, we set **Show 3D Widget** to True. Now, after adding the Blueprint to the level, 3D widgets will appear at the positions defined by Point A and Point B.
The 3D widgets allow us to easily change the values of **Point A** and **Point B** by moving them in the viewport.

![](Points1And2Viewport.png)(w:700)

Now when we test the map, the distance between the two points is logged on every tick, proving that our Function is working.

![](WithBPEditorClosed.png)

### Calling Functions from External Blueprints

You can also call a **Function** in a Blueprint from inside another Blueprint, as long as you have reference to the Blueprint that contains the Function you want to call. 

Take for example below, we have a Function in our Character Blueprint (which is called **MyCharacter**) called **Take Damage** which reduces a variable called **PlayerHealth** by 10 whenever it is called.

![](PlayerHealthFunction.png)

Inside another Blueprint, which is a projectile that gets spawned when the player fires a weapon from the **MyCharacter** Blueprint, we have some script for what happens when the projectile hits something. 

[REGION:fullwidth]
![](DefaultProjectile.png)
[/REGION:fullwidth]

The script, which is the default **MyProjectile** Blueprint that is included with the Blueprint First Person Template Project, already does something when the projectile hits something that is simulating physics and adds impulse at the location it was hit. Say we wanted to check if we hit the player and if we did, to call the **Take Damage** Function. 

We can do so by dragging off the **Other** pin of the **Event Hit** and **Casting To** our **MyCharacter** Blueprint. 

![](CastToMyCharacter.png)

Once we do that, we have a reference to our player character and can then drag off the **As My Character** pin and call the Function **Take Damage** that resides in that Blueprint. 

[REGION:fullwidth]
![](CallFunction.png)
[/REGION:fullwidth]

We could then hook up the rest of the script to destroy the projectile after it hits the player as so: 

[REGION:fullwidth]
![](FullProjectileScript.png)
[/REGION:fullwidth]

And if we were to play in the editor, we would see something similar to below. 

[OBJECT:EmbeddedVideo]
[PARAMLITERAL:width]
640
[/PARAMLITERAL]
[PARAMLITERAL:height]
360
[/PARAMLITERAL]
[PARAMLITERAL:videoid]
T8dbefQDqQs
[/PARAMLITERAL]
[/OBJECT]

We have hooked the **PlayerHealth** variable up to a **PrintString** node so that we can show its current value. By default its set to 100 and when the player shoots into the wall and it bounces back and hits the player, you can see that the **Take Damage** function is being called and reduces the **PlayerHealth** variable by 10 each time they are hit. 





## Troubleshooting Functions

If you get a **Warning!** bar on your Function call node with an **"Unable to find function with name [FunctionName]"** message, **Compile** your Blueprint. 

![](function_warning.png)

If you change the number of input or output parameters on your Function, you will also need to **Compile** your Blueprint.
