[EXCERPT:Intro]
**Variables** are properties that hold a value or reference an Object or Actor in the world. These 
properties can be accessible internally to the **Blueprint** containing them, or they can be made 
accessible externally so that their values can be modified by designers working with instances 
of the Blueprint placed in a level.
[/EXCERPT:Intro]

Variables are displayed as rounded boxes that contain the name of the variable:

## Variable Types

Variables can be created in a variety of different types, including data types - such as Boolean, integer, and float - as well as reference types for holding things like Objects, Actors, and particular Classes. 
[Arrays](Engine/Blueprints\UserGuide\Arrays) of each variable type can also be created.  Each type is color coded for easy identification:

[EXCERPT:VarColor]

| Variable Type | Color   | Example | Usage |
| -----------   | ------  | --- | --- |
| **Boolean**   | Red     | ![](RedWire.png) | Red variables represent Boolean (true/false) data. |
| **Integer**   | Cyan    | ![](CyanWire.png) | Cyan variables represent integer data, or numbers without decimals such as 0, 152, and -226.
| **Float**     | Green   | ![](GreenWire.png) | Green variables represent float data, or numbers with decimals such as 0.0553, 101.2887, and -78.322.
| **String**    | Magenta | ![](MagentaWire.png) | Magenta variables represent string data, or a group of alphanumeric characters such as Hello World. |
| **Text**      | Pink	  | ![](PinkWire.png) | Pink variables represent displayed text data, especially where that text is localization aware. |
| **Vector**    | Gold    | ![](GoldWire.png) | Gold variables represent vector data, or numbers consisting of float numbers for 3 elements or axes such as XYZ or RGB information. |
| **Rotator**   | Purple  | ![](PurpleWire.png) | Purple variables represent Rotator data, which is a group of numbers that define rotation in 3D space. |
| **Transform** | Orange  | ![](OrangeWire.png) | Orange variables represent Transform data, which combines translation (3D position), rotation, and scale. |
| **Object**	| Blue    |  ![](BlueWire.png)	| Blue variables represent Objects, including Lights, Actors, StaticMeshes, Cameras, and SoundCues. |

## Variables in the My Blueprint Tab

[EXCERPT:Panel]

The **My Blueprint** tab allows custom variables to be added to the Blueprint and lists any existing 
variables, including component instance variables added in the [Components List](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Components) 
or variables created by promoting a value to a variable in the graph.

[/EXCERPT:Panel]

[EXCERPT:CreatingVariables]

## Creating Variables

Creating a variable inside a Blueprint can be achieved by following the steps below. 

1.  [Create a Blueprint](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Types/ClassBlueprint/Creation) and open it up to the **Graph** tab. 

1.  Create a new variable from the **MyBlueprint** window, by clicking on the **Add Button** ![](Engine\Blueprints\Editor\UIComponents\MyBlueprint\plus_Button.png) on the variable list header ![](Engine\Blueprints\Editor\UIComponents\MyBlueprint\myblueprint_variable.png).

	![](MyBlueprintPane_createVar.png)

1.  A new variable will be created, prompting you to enter a name for it. 

	![](HT5.png)

	Enter a name for your Blueprint, then proceed to the **Details** panel to adjust the properties of the variable.

1.  In the **Details** panel, there are several settings that can be used to define how your variable is used or accessed. 

	![](HT6.png)

	[REGION:note]
	In order to set the **Default Value** for a variable, you must first **Compile** the Blueprint. 
	[/REGION]

| Option | Description |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Variable Name** | The name of the variable. |
| **Variable Type** | Set the [Variable Type](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Variables#variabletypes) via the dropdown menu and determine if the variable is an [Array](Engine/Blueprints/BP_HowTo/WorkingWithArrays) or not. |
| **Editable** | Whether the variable is publically editable on instances of the Blueprint. |
| **Tooltip** | Extra information about this variable, shown when the cursor is over the variable. |
| **Expose on Spawn** | Should the variable be exposed as a pin when spawning the Blueprint. |
| **Private** | Should the variable be private (derived Blueprints cannot modify it). |
| **Expose to Matinee** | Should the variable be exposed for **Matinee** to modify it. |
| **Config Variable** | Allows the variable to be set from a config file. |
| **Category** | Allows you to categorize the variable by a label given. Variables will be sorted by their label. |
| **Replication** | Should this variable be [Replicated](Gameplay/HowTo/Networking/ReplicateVariable/Blueprints) over the network or not. |

There are some serialization options that can be defined by expanding the **Details** panel as well. 

![](HT37.png)

Here you can set whether or not the variable is serialized and is zero-filled at load with the **Transient** option. You can also set whether or not the variable is serialized for saved games with the **SaveGame** option.

### Editable Variables

[EXCERPT:editingvars]

When a variable is set to **Editable**, this allows the variable to be modified from outside of the Blueprint that the variable resides in. 

[REGION:raw]
![](HT21.png)
[/REGION]

You can set a variable to Editable from either the **Details** panel under the **Editable** setting, or by clicking the **Closed Eye** icon next to the variable inside the **MyBlueprint** window. When the eye icon is closed, the variable is currently set to non-editable (which is the default setting). When the eye icon is open, the variable is set to **Public** (or **Editable** as seen below). 

When a variable is set to Editable, you can set the value of the variable from the **Details** panel of the Main Editor window. 

![](HT23.png)

Above, the variable **LightColor** has been set to Editable and we can now set this value in the **Details** panel of the Level Editor. 

[/EXCERPT:editingvars]

### Variable Tooltips

You can also add a **Tooltip** for your variables that will appear when mousing over the variable in the editor. 

![](HT25.png)

You can add the **Tooltip** from the **Details** panel of the variable. When doing so, if the variable is set to **Public**, the Eye Icon will change from yellow to green indicating that a Tooltip has been written for the variable.

[REGION:raw]
![](HT24.png)
[/REGION]

### Expose on Spawn

The **Expose on Spawn** option allows you to set if the variable should be accessible at the time of spawning the Blueprint it sits in. 

![](HT26.png)

Above we have a variable called **LightColor** which is a Linear Color property that is set to **Expose on Spawn**. This variable is implemented in a Blueprint for a Point Light that uses the **Set Light Color** node and the **LightColor** variable to determine the color the light should be. 

Below, inside a different Blueprint, a script is used to spawn the Point Light Blueprint and since the **LightColor** variable was set to Expose on Spawn, the option to set the value is made available on the **Spawn Actor from Class** node, allowing us to set its color when the light spawns in the game world. 

![](HT27.png)

### Private Variables

With the **Private** option checked on a variable, this prevents the variable from being modified from external Blueprints. 

For example, we have a variable below that is not set to private: 

![](HT42.png)

Inside another Blueprint, we spawn the Blueprint that contains the variable, then off the **Return Value** we can access our variable. 

![](HT43.png)

If we were to set it Private however: 

![](HT41.png)

And spawn the Blueprint again and try to access that variable, we cannot. 

![](HT44.png)


### Expose to Matinee

In order for a variable to be affected by **Matinee**, you need to check the **Expose to Matinee** option. 

![](HT31.png)

Below, we have created a Matinee and added a track containing our Blueprint. We then want to modify the Linear Color variable in that Blueprint through Matinee and can do so by adding the **LinearColor Property Track**. 

![](HT32.png)

We are then prompted to select the LinearColor variable to modify from our Blueprint (our **LightColor**) property. 

![](HT33.png)

Once we have done so, we can then add keys to the track to modify the value of the variable over time. 

![](HT34.png)

[REGION:note]
See the [](Engine/Matinee) documentation for more information on working with **Matinee**. 
[/REGION]


## Promoting to Variable

[EXCERPT:PromoteVariable]

You can also create variables by using the **Promote to Variable** option. 

**Right-click** on any input or output data pins on a Blueprint node and select the **Promote to Variable** option. 

![](HT38.png)

By **Right-clicking** on the **New Light Color** pin and selecting **Promote to Variable**, we can assign a variable as the **New Light Color** value. 

![](HT40.png)

Alternatively, you can drag off an input or output pin and select the **Promote to Variable** option. 

![](HT39.png)

[/EXCERPT:PromoteVariable]

## Accessing Variables in Blueprints

When working with variables in Blueprints, typically you will be accessing them in one of two ways: by use the **Get** node (referred to as a Getter) to get the value of the variable or using the **Set** node (referred to as a Setter) to set the value of the variable. 

![](HT45.png)

You can create a **Set** node (1 above) or **Get** node (2 above) for a variable by **Right-clicking** in the graph and typing either **Set (variable name)** or **Get (variable name)**. Another method you can use is to hold down the **Ctrl** key and drag in the variable from the **MyBlueprint** window to create a **Get** node or hold down the **Alt** key and drag in the variable from **MyBlueprint** window to create a **Set** node. 











## Editing Variables

Variable values can be set either as a part of the Blueprint node network or as a default value prior to execution. To set variable default values:

1. Click the **Class Defaults** button on the Blueprint Editor Tool bar to open the Defaults in the **Details** panel.

1. In the **Details** panel, enter the desired default values to the right of your variable name.

	![](blueprint_details_variable_callout.png)

	Above we have highlighted our Color variable in which we can set its default color. 

[REGION:note]
If you do not see your variable listed in the defaults, make sure you have clicked the  **Compile** button. 
[/REGION]



### Renaming Variables

To rename a variable:

1. **Right-click** on the variable name in the **My Blueprint** tab and select **Rename** in the menu that appears.

	![](rename_variable_menu.png)

1. Type the new variable name in the text box and then press **Enter** to save it.

	![](rename_variable.png)

### Variable Properties

You can set all the properties for a variable in the **Details** panel.  Some variables may have more properties than those shown here, such as **Expose to Matinee** for Vectors or a **Slider Range** for numeric variables like Integers or Floats.

|Property|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|**Variable Type** | Set the variable type in the dropdown menu and determine whether or not the variable is an array.| 
|**Editable**| Set whether or not it is possible to edit the value of the variable in the  **Class Defaults** and the Blueprint's **Details** tab. |
|**Tooltip**| Set the tooltip for the variable. |
|**Private** | Set whether or not this variable should be private and not modified by derived Blueprints. |
|**Category** | Choose from an existing category or type a new Category name.  Setting the Category determines where the variable appears in the **Class Defaults**, the **My Blueprint** tab, and the Blueprint's **Details** tab.| 
|**Replication** | Choose if the variable's value should or should not be replicated across clients, and if the value is replicated, if there should be a notification by way of a callback function. | 

### Getting & Setting Variable Values

Variables can also be edited as a part of your Blueprint network by way of Get and Set nodes. The easiest way to create these is by dragging a variable from the Variables tab directly into the Event Graph. A small menu will appear asking if you would like to create a Get or Set node. 


![](VariableGetSet.png)(w:600)


#### Get Nodes

Get nodes supply portions of the network with a variable value. Once created, these nodes can be plugged into any node that takes the appropriate type.

![](GetVariable.png)

#### Set Nodes

Set nodes allow you to change the value of a variable. Note that these must be called by an execution wire in order to execute.

![](SetVariable.png)

| **Shortcuts when dragging from the My Blueprint tab** | |
|--- | --- |
|**Ctrl-drag** | Creates a Get node. |
|**Alt-drag** | Creates a Set node. |
