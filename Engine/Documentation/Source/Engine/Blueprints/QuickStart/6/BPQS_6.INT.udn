Our launchpad is going to work by using a function called **Launch Character**. The **Launch Character** function adds the velocity you specify to the Character's current velocity, allowing
you to throw it in whichever direction you would like. It only works on Characters, though, so we need to make sure that our Pawn (avatar) is a Character (humanoid avatar). 

We do this by casting. Casting attempts to convert your input into a different type, so you can access specific functionality that is only allowed for that particular type. It will succeed if 
your input is based on that type. 

Everything you can place in your level is an Actor, in addition to any other specialized behavior added on later. That means that you can get a reference to anything in your level, cast it to **Actor**, 
and it will succeed. However, not everything in your level is the Pawn representing you in the game, so casting something to **Pawn** may or may not succeed. 

1. Drag off of the **Return Value** pin of **Get Player Pawn**. 
1. Type "Cast" into the search box, then select **Cast to Character** in the context menu.

1. Drag off of **As Character** pin on the **Cast** node.  
1. Type "Launch" into the search box, then select **Launch Character** in the context menu.

	[REGION:note]
	Notice that the output execution pin for successfully casting automatically connected to the input execution pin of **Launch Character**.

1. Type "3000" into the Z field of the **Launch Character** node.
1. Finally, wire up the **True** execution pin of the **Branch** node to the **Cast to Character** node's input execution pin, so the **Cast to Character** and **Launch Character** only occur if the overlapping Actor is our Pawn.

	At this point, **Compile** and **Save** the Blueprint using the toolbar buttons, then close the Blueprint Editor.

1. Drag several of the launchpads into your level from the **Content Browser**.

1. Click on **Play** in the toolbar, then run around the level (with WASD) and jump (with Spacebar). Land on one of the platforms and watch as you go flying through the air!
