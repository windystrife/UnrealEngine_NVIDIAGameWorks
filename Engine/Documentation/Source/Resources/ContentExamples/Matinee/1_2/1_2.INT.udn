Tracks and Keys are what matinee is about. Your main window is track view and each track has key frames on a time line.

I right clicked in the Track View and create a New Empty Group. There are other Groups these groups are more specific for its usage and I will explain later. It is also possible to add Folders. They are only for organizing huge matinees.

No we need to add an Actor to the Group. In UE3 this was done by hooking it up in kismet but not anymore. You have to right click on the group->Actors->add selected Actors. Actor needs to be selected in viewport. You then see all actors in that list that have been added to the group.

No we can add a track. I chose a Movement Track. 

Movement Track lets you modify the transformation of the actor. It will create a Track and a Key at 0.00 in the timeline (dark red triangle). By moving the black bar at the bottom of the time line we can scrub though the time line and when we click add key it will create a key on the Movement track at the current time. As long as the Key is selected we can modify it by simply moving the actor in the viewport.

Pressing the Play button will play the animation.
