There are a number of methods in which you can create the geometry that comprise your levels in Unreal Engine 4. Generally speaking, it is better (more efficient performance wise) to use [Static Meshes](Engine/Content\Types\StaticMeshes) when creating the geometry.
That said, since creating Static Meshes requires some sort of 3D modeling software, you can use the **Geometry Editing** tools to quickly block out your levels for gameplay prototyping. 

This page covers the **Geometry_Editing** map and illustrates how to begin blocking out levels by using **Additive** and **Subtractive Brushes** to define the areas where geometry exists. By the end of the examples, you will learn how to build a house entirely out of Brushes and should have enough knowledge to start blocking out your own levels.

## Geometry_Editing Map

Listed below are the examples provided in the Geometry_Editing map: 

| Example | What is Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **1.1 Additive and Subtractive Geometry Example** | Shows how Additive and Subtractive Brushes interact with one another. |
| **1.2 Order Example** | Shows how the order in which you place Additive or Subtractive Brushes can affect how they interact with one another. |
| **1.3 Solidity Example** | Shows how a Brush can collide differently with objects based on its Solidity setting. (e.g. whether a Brush causes cuts to be created in surrounding brushes or if it collides with objects in the world). |
| **1.4 Surface Properties Example** | Shows how to control how textures that are placed across your surfaces as well as lightmap resolution via the Surface Properties options. |
| **1.5 Edit Geometry Example** | This example demonstrates how to edit a Brush's shape with Edit Mode by clicking on the Edit (Shift+5) button. |
| **1.6 Example House** | This is an example of using Additive and Subtractive Brushes to construct a house with windows and a door opening. |
