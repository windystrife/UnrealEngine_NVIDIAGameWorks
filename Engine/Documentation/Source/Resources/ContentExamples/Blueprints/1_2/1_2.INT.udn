**Components** can be thought of as the objects that will be needed for a **Blueprint** object to fulfill its purpose. There are many types of Components that can be added to a Blueprint. For example, if you know your Blueprint will need some sort of polygonal mesh to help define it, then you can add a **Static Mesh Component**. If your Blueprint object needs to emit light, you can add a **Point Light Component** or perhaps a **Spot Light Component**. 

In this example, we see a series of Blueprint Actors, each showing some of the available Components. 

## Components

From left to right, these Blueprint Actors are:

* **BP_SpriteComponent** - This just contains a Billboard Component, which is often used as an aid in Blueprint placement.
* **BP_StaticMeshComponent** - This Blueprint Actor contains only a Static Mesh Component, which is used when the Blueprint Actor needs a polygonal mesh or model to define it.
* **BP_PointLightComponent** - This has only a Point Light Component inside of it, which would be used when a Blueprint Actor needs to emit light.
* **BP_SeveralComponents** - This contains one of all of the above components, including a Billboard Component, a Static Mesh Component, and a Point Light Component.


For each of these Blueprint Actors, their respective Components were each added within the Blueprint Editor in the **Component** tab. The **Component** tab is displayed at the top-left of the Blueprint Editor window by default, as shown below. To see various ways to add and remove components, please see the [Blueprint Components documentation.](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Components)
