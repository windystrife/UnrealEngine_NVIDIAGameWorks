This example is best seen during Play In Editor or Simulation. To Simulate, click the **Simulate** button located at the top of the screen in the editor Toolbar, or press **Alt-S**. To Play in the Editor, click the **Play** button, also located in the toolbar, or press **Alt-P**.

This example simply shows how to make an update to a Component's property using the Event Graph by using the classic programmer introductory project of "Hello World." Simply put, the Blueprint script for the object sets the Text property of a Text Render Component to "Hello World" as soon as gameplay begins. Prior to gameplay, such as when using the editor, the Text property will be blank so no text will appear. This is one of the simplest and most basic approaches to demonstrating the Event Graph and Blueprint setup.

As with all examples in this level, the object displayed is a Blueprint Actor, meaning it is a Blueprint created with the Actor class as a parent. 

## Components
There are only two Components in this setup:

* A **Billboard Component**, which is used for placement and easy selection. This is named **Billboard1**, which is the default name. We will not need to refer to this in our Blueprint.
* A **Text Render Component**, which will have its Text property updated at the beginning of gameplay. This is named **HelloWorld**, and we will refer to it in the Event Graph to change the text.

## Construction Script
In this example, we do not use the Construction Script. This is because we do not need anything to happen during level editing (construction) time. 

## Event Graph
The Event Graph starts with a **Begin Play** event. We then make a reference to the HelloWorld Text Render, and from that we create the **Set Text** node, which we can use to change the Text property to anything we like.
