The Content Examples provided inside the **MorphTargets** map demonstrate how with the use of a Skeletal Mesh (and additional assets outlined below in example 1.2), it is possible to use a Morph Target to blend between objects or scale aspects of a Skeletal Mesh. 
This map contains five examples ranging from a basic Morph Target setup, to manipulating Materials to match a Morph Target and even scaling facial features of a Skeletal Mesh. 


## MorphTargets Map

![](MorphTargets_Topic.png)(w:640)

Listed below are the examples provided inside the **MorphTargets** map:

| Example | What is Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **1.1 Basic Morph Target** | A very basic Morph Target example with an animation sequence (e.g. a cube that morphs into a sphere). |
| **1.2 Morph Target Assets** | The assets needed to use a Morph Target (e.g. FBX Skeletal Mesh, Skeleton, Physics Asset, Animation Sequence, and a Material with Used with Morph Targets checked in its properties). |
| **1.3 Morphing Material Settings** | Demonstrates how to morph between materials (e.g. a cube that morphs into a sphere and changes its material). |
| **1.4 Vertex Normals** | Description on how custom Vertex Normals may be used with Morph Targets. |
| **1.5 Morph Targets on Skeletal Mesh** | Shows how a Skeletal Mesh can use a Morph Target to manipulate its facial features (e.g. Owen character's nose is increase/decreased in size). |
