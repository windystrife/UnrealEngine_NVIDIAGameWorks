In order to view both **Server** and **Client** perspectives, on the **Play** dropdown, set the **Number of Clients** field to 2.

Oftentimes, it is desired to execute some logic in response to the value of a replicated variable changing. Variables that are marked **RepNotify**, have a special function called automatically any time the value is changed, on both Network Authority and Remote Machines. 

In this example, the Network Authority controls changing a scalar value indicating which color the streetlight should display using a RepNotify variable. When the value is changed, the auto-generated OnRep function is called, which in this example then updates a material parameter. 

## Blueprint Breakdown
In the **BP_Stoplight_Variable_RepNotify** Blueprint's Event Graph (pictured below), you will see that the script calls for only the Network Authority to handle the light switching logic. The **Streetlight Scalar** variable representing the state of the light is specifically marked as RepNotify, so both the Client and Server have the **OnRep_StreetlightScalar** function called when the value changes.

The **OnRep_StreetlightScalar** function then handles updating the visuals of the streetlight such that it works on all machines. 

Setting a variable to RepNotify can be done through the **Details** panel of the variable under the **Replication** drop down menu.

With this setup, both Client and Server see the same sequence executed for the streetlight when playing in game.
