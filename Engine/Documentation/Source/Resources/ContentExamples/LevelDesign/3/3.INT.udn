In the lighting pass, the final lights are placed throughout the level.  These lights will have their settings tweaked to match the final desired look and feel of the level, rather than simply serving to 
provide basic illumination.  Post processing effects are also adjusted at this stage, again to match the final look and feel of the level. The changes in the lighting and post processing effects may also 
mean that changes to the materials applied throughout the level are necessary.  Finally, some particle effects may be added to the level. For instance, if the lighting in a level is done with torches, the particle
effects for the flames on the torches can be added during this pass.
