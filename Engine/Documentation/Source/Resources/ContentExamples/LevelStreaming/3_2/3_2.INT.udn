Unloading is simply done with "Unload Level Stream" 

Using those two functions to stream level is one of hardest ways to setup it is even more work than volumes. And the biggest disadvantage is the Play from Camera position in the editor will most likely fail to load the right streaming levels and you miss levels that should be loaded. A typical use case for this kind of streaming would be during a cinematic. While cinematic is playing the camera could jump around and it could be a lot of work to cover all the areas with proper streaming volumes. With the function u can just call it and be sure the level will be loaded when the cinematic finishes.
