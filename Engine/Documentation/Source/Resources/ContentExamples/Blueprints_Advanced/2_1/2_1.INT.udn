The **BP_Timeline_Ball** Blueprint demonstrates a basic [Timeline](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Timelines) in the Event Graph, which automatically plays and loops, triggering an event at a certain point along the Timeline that spawns a particle effect.

-	Timeline nodes do not actually affect components themselves, but instead output changing values as they play, which can be fed into **Lerp** nodes connected to nodes such as **Set Relative Location** in order to animate a component.
-	An event track inside the timeline causes a matching execution pin on the **Bounce** timeline node to fire whenever that event track has a key. In this case, the event track is used to spawn a particle effect whenever the ball bounces.
