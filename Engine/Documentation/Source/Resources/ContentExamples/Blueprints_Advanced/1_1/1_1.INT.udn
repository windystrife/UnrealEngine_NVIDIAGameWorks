The **BP_Random_Meshes** Blueprint uses the Construction Script to randomly scatter Static Meshes within a radius, using exposed variables to allow users to customize the scale, rotation, and spacing of the Static Meshes. All of the Static Meshes are actually components within the BP_Random_Meshes Blueprint.

*	A **ForLoop** node is used to repeat a section of script a specified number of times. In this case, the Number of meshes variable is also the number of times the ForLoop will repeat, adding a new StaticMeshComponent each time.
*	**RandomFloatInRange** nodes are used to randomize the location, scale, and rotation of the StaticMeshComponents, as well as the StaticMesh assets being used.
*	An array is used to allow the user to specify a list of possible StaticMeshes that will be set for the StaticMeshComponents in the Blueprint. After each StaticMeshComponent is added, a StaticMesh asset is picked from the array using a random index number and assigned to the newly added  StaticMeshComponent.
