The **FBX_Import_Options** map shows some of the options that can be set when importing an FBX asset into Unreal Engine 4. 

When importing a **Static Mesh**, **Skeletal Mesh**, or **Animation** asset in FBX format, you will be presented with the **Import Options** dialogue box as seen below.

Depending on the type of asset being imported, additional options will become available such as importing an asset along with its materials/textures, LOD 
options as well as animation and morph target options.
