## 概述

在 **Content Examples** （内容示例）项目中的 **Audio Map** （音频图）是查看所有的音频系统如何组合到一起，并在比特大小的实际示例中展示它们的一手的出色来源。 本页面旨在让您了解从音频 **内容示例** 中可以了解的内容以及如何基于您想要查看的音频系统来搜寻特定示例。 


## 音频图

![](contentExamplesStarterMap.png)(w:640)

**音频** 图让您了解在虚幻引擎4中使用音频的核心理念。本图涵盖了许多主题，包括了音频资源的不同类型以及如何使用它们来制作基于您需要的不同特效。 无论您是刚使用虚幻引擎4中的音频，还是需要更新的课程，此图都将为您提供出色的基础。 

| 示例 |  展示的内容 |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **1.1 AmbientSound Actor** （环境声音Actor）| 为只触发一次的事件而播放的音频。 |
| **1.2 AmbientSound Looping** （环境声音循环）| 音频不断地持续播放，直到被告知停止。 |
| **1.3 AmbientSound Spatialize** （环境声音空间化）| 自声音位置处播放的音频、 |
| **1.4 AmbientSound Attenuation** （环境声音衰减）| 自声音位置处播放的音频，并会基于距离声音的距离而变得更响或更柔和。 |
| **1.5 Attenuation with Low Pass Filter (LPF)** （低通滤波衰减）| 自声音位置处播放的音频，并且会随着玩家距离声音的距离拉远而更低沉。  |
| **1.6 Attenuation Shapes** （衰减形状）|在指定的形状内（例如球体，胶囊体，盒体或椎体）自声音位置播放的音频。 |
| **1.7 Shared Attenuation Settings** （共享的衰减设置）| 展示影响多个 **声音Actors** 的 **衰减** 的 **声音衰减** 资源。 |
| **1.8 AmbientSound Actor using SoundCues** （使用声效的环境声音Actor）| 展示如何使用 **声效** 而非 **声波** 来创建更为复杂的声音或把多个声音混合到一个。 |
| **1.9 Audio Volume** （音频体积）|音频受 **音频体积** 的影响，其效果仅在玩家位于体积内时才能听到（例如当您在体积内时，您听到的对话播放和声音如同您在礼堂内所听到的那样。 当您在体积外时，对话正常播放）。 |
| **1.10 Audio Volume using Ambient Zone** （使用环境区域的音频体积）| 两种声音受到 **环境区域** 的影响，一种声音被放置在 **音频体积** 内，而另一种则不是。 体积内的声音在 **音频体积** 外时较轻，但在 **音频体积** 内时较响，而体积外的声音在 **音频体积** 内时较轻，但在 **音频体积** 外时较响（例如，当晚间从内部环境移动到外部环境时的音频）。 |

### Sound Cue Node Usage
The **Sound Cue Node Usage** section covers more in-depth usage of the **Sound Cue Editor** including: combining multiple **Sound Waves**, selective **Attenuation**, **Random** and **Delayed** playback of **Sound Waves**, and **Modulation**. 

| Example | What's Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **2.1 Mixer** | Two separate sounds fed through a **Mixer** node to produce a combined audio effect (e.g. ambient sounds with dripping water).  |
| **2.2 Attenuation** | A combination of two sounds with separate **Attenuation** settings where the falloff of each sound is independent of one another (e.g. audio effect from 2.1, however dripping water gets quieter the further you move away while ambient remains). |
| **2.3 Modulator** | Audio that plays back at a random volume or pitch based on its Min/Max settings (e.g. a dog that barks at a different pitch each time it's triggered). |
| **2.4 Random** | Randomly select a non-looping sound for playback each time the **Sound Cue** is triggered (e.g. a different bird call is played each time it is triggered). |
| **2.5 Delay + Looping** | Randomly select a non-looping sound for playback that repeats and has a delay between each playback (e.g. different bird calls are played and looped randomly with a delay between each sound). |


### Reverb + Ambient Zone Usage
The **Reverb + Ambient Zone Usage** section covers a how to use an **Audio Volume** and **Reverb Effect**, along with sound assets to produce dialogue that sounds as if you are standing in an auditorium. This section also covers how to use **Ambient Zones** and **Sound Classes** to generate interior/exterior sounds that play together where the volumes adjust based on whether you are inside or out. 

| Example | What's Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **3.1 Reverb** | Audio is affected by an **Audio Volume** where its effects can only be heard when the player is inside the volume (e.g. Dialogue plays inside a building and sounds like an auditorium. When outside, dialogue plays normally). |
| **3.2 Ambient Zone** | Two sounds are affected by an **Ambient Zone** where one sound is placed inside an **Audio Volume** and the other is not. The inside sound is quite while outside the **Audio Volume** but louder when inside, while the outside sound is quite when inside the **Audio Volume** and louder while standing outside it (e.g. audio when moving from an indoor to outdoor environment at night). |


### Ambient Showcase
The **Ambient Showcase** provides additional usage examples and illustrates how to use the four **Attenuation Shapes**, using audio in **Blueprints** to create rotating and moving sounds with **Attenuation**, and advanced usages of **Audio Volumes** and **Ambient Zones**. 

| Example | What's Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **4.1 Ambient Zone with Box Attenuation** | Showcases audio with **Attenuation** and an **Ambient Zone** inside a box-shaped room (e.g. entering the cockpit of an idle airplane). |
| **4.2 Rotating Cone Attenuation** | Audio is attached to a rotating object where the sound fades in/out based on it's location to the player (e.g. a rotating scanner device) |
| **4.3 Moving Sphere Attenuation** | Audio is attached to an object that moves forwards/backwards where the sound fades in/out based on it's location to the player and is adjusted based on that distance (e.g. a swarm of bees moving towards/away from you). |
| **4.4 Ambient Zone with Sphere Attenuation** | Showcases audio with **Attenuation** and an **Ambient Zone** inside a spherical room (e.g. the ambient machine noise of a mainframe or server room). |
| **4.5 Ambient Zone with Capsule Attenuation** | Showcases audio with **Attenuation** and an **Ambient Zone** inside a capsule-shaped room (e.g. exiting or entering a moving train car). |
| **4.6 Reverb + Ambient Zone with Cone Attenuation** | Showcases audio with **Attention**, **Reverb**, and an **Ambient Zone** inside a conical room (e.g. several sounds and dialogue come together to form a science fiction type setting). |


## Audio_Advanced Map

![](contentExamplesHeader.png)(w:640)

The **Audio_Advanced** map builds off the examples given in the **Starter Map** and demonstrates how to get the most out of the audio system in Unreal Engine 4. 
It offers more in-depth coverage of using audio in **Blueprints** and advanced **Sound Cue Node**, **Sound Class**, and **Sound Mix** usage samples. Using audio in **Matinee** and generating **Surface Sounds** are also covered in this map.

### Blueprint Sound Node Usage
The **Blueprint Sound Node Usage** section covers many topics including how to play a sound at a specific location or attached to an **Actor**, how to start/stop a sound through **Blueprints**, and how to create and add **Reverb** to a sound without using a volume.

| Example | What's Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **1.1 Play Sound at Location** | Audio that plays from a set location (e.g. audio is heard playing from the location of a spark effect). |
| **1.2 Play Sound Attached** | Audio that plays and is attached to a moving Actor (e.g. audio is heard emitting and attached to a moving chicken). |
| **1.3 Play/Stop** | Showcases, through **Blueprints**, how to start or stop a looping sound. |
| **1.4 Fade In/Fade Out** | Showcases, through **Blueprints**, how to add a fade in or fade out effect to a sound. |
| **1.5 Adjust Volume** | Showcases, through **Blueprints**, how to adjust the volume of a sound that is currently playing. |
| **1.6 Set Pitch Multiplier** | Showcases, through **Blueprints**, how to change the pitch of a sound that is currently playing. |
| **1.7 Set Sound** | Showcases, through **Blueprints**, how to change the sound asset assigned to an audio component. |
| **1.8 Is Playing** | Showcases, through **Blueprints**, how to have an audio component return it's current **Playing** or **Not Playing** condition. |
| **1.9 Activate/Deactivate Reverb Effect** | Showcases, through **Blueprints**, how to activate **Reverb Effects** without using an **Audio Volume**. |

### Advanced Sound Cue Node Usage
The **Advanced Sound Cue Node Usage** demos are setup using **Blueprints** and covers examples on how to have a sound adjust its volume or pitch over time, more advanced cross-fading techniques, using float values to drive effects, using Booleans inside of **Sound Cues**, and **Doppler** effects. 

| Example | What's Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **2.1 Enveloper** | Audio that changes its volume and pitch over time (e.g. a dying police car siren). |
| **2.2 Oscillator** | Showcases how to have audio that moves back-and-forth between volume, pitch, and frequency settings. |
| **2.3 Group Control** | Showcases how to play different sounds based on the number of identical **Sound Cues** playing (e.g. one soldier marching versus a platoon of soldiers). |
| **2.4 Branch** | Showcases how to setup a Boolean inside a **Sound Cue** and play a sound based on its condition (e.g. a police siren that only plays if a revving engine is playing). |
| **2.5 Wave Param** | Showcases how to specify a sound within a **Sound Cue** that can be swapped out at anytime through **Blueprints**. |
| **2.6 Continuous Modulator** | Audio that modulates based on an incoming float value (e.g. a car engine that gets louder or softer based on speed). |
| **2.7 Crossfade By Param** | Showcases how to have multiple sounds that fade in or out based on an incoming float value.  |
| **2.8 Crossfade By Distance** | Showcases how to play different sounds that fade in or out based on the **Sound Cue's** distance from the player. |
| **2.9 Doppler** | Showcases how to add a **Doppler** effect to a sound in motion (e.g. a jet engine sound based on distance from the player). |


### Sound Class + Sound Mix Usage
The **Sound Class + Sound Mix Usage** section demonstrates how the two are different as well as how they work together. 
A prime example is given showing how to use **Sound Mixes** to combine music, audio, and combat sounds as well as how to focus in on sounds by pushing or popping them. 
There are also examples on **Passive Sound Mixes** which activate and deactivate automatically as well as using Low/High Pass Filters, or how to apply a radio transmission effect to your audio. 

| Example | What's Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **3.1 Set Base Sound Mix** | Showcases how to set up a **Sound Mix** containing multiple **Sound Cues** (e.g. basic mix of dialogue, music, and background sounds) |
| **3.2 Dialogue Focused Sound Mix** | While playing audio from 3.1, this illustrates how to push/pop the **Dialogue** so that it is louder/softer than the other sounds. |
| **3.3 Music Focused Sound Mix** | While playing audio from 3.1, this illustrates how to push/pop the **Music** so that it is louder/softer than the other sounds. |
| **3.4 Background Focused Sound Mix** | While playing audio from 3.1, this illustrates how to push/pop the **Background** combat sounds so that they are louder/softer than the other sounds. |
| **3.5 Clear Sound Mix Modifiers** | While playing audio from 3.1 and activating 3.2, 3.3, or 3.4 to focus on a sound, this illustrates how to clear all currently pushed **Sound Mixes**. |
| **3.6 Passive Sound Mix** | Showcases how to have **Sound Mixes** activate and deactivate automatically based on **Sound Classes* (e.g. whenever a sound is played, other sounds automatically adjust). |
| **3.7 EQ** | Showcases how to apply equalizer effects to a sound that is playing by using Low/High Pass Filters by pushing/popping them in **Blueprints**. |
| **3.8 Radio Filter** | Showcases how to apply a radio transmission effect to a sound.  |


### Matinee Sound Usage
The **Matinee Sound Usage** section covers how to use sound within **Matinee** sequences. This includes attaching sounds to Static Meshes or the camera, using the **Sound Track** in **Matinee**, and using **Volume** and **Pitch** curves. 

| Example | What's Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **4.1 Attach Sound Actor to Static Mesh** | Audio that plays while attached to a Static Mesh Actor that moves around in a **Matinee** sequence. |
| **4.2 Attach Sound Actor to Camera** | Audio that plays from the location of a camera inside a **Matinee** sequence. |
| **4.3 Sound Track** | Showcases how to add audio to a **Matinee** by using the **Sound Track** and attach it to an Actor in the scene (e.g. dialogue that plays from the location of a character who walks around in a scene).|
| **4.4 Volume and Pitch Curves** | Showcases how to fade **Sound Tracks** in and out using **Volume** and **Pitch** curves (e.g. adjusting the music pitch to account for a slow-motion sequence).  |


### Blueprint Sound Node Showcases
The **Blueprint Sound Node Showcase** provides more tailored examples of using the audio systems to bring to life effects like fireworks or objects like a flickering fluorescent light. 
There are also examples showing how to dynamically alter the audio experience based on game events (like triggering an alarm), play sounds at random locations, modifying the pitch of a sound based on its movement, as well as attaching and playing sound from a specific location of a character.

| Example | What's Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **5.1 Volume Ducking** | Audio that plays inside an encapsulated room. **Reverb** effects are altered based on whether or not the player is inside the room with the door closed or open. |
| **5.2 Play Sound at Particle Collision** | Audio is played at the location of particle collision (e.g. a bouncing particle effect that emits sound when colliding). |
| **5.3 Play Sound at Particle Spawn and Particle Death** | Audio that plays at a particle's spawn location with different audio that plays at its destroy location (e.g. fireworks flying in the air then exploding). |
| **5.4 Set Volume Multiplier With Timeline Driven Float** | Audio that adjusts its volume based on a float value defined by a **Timeline** curve (e.g. a flickering fluorescent light). |
| **5.5 Play Sounds at Random Locations Around an Object** | Showcases audio that plays randomly around the player pawn. Also shows audio that plays randomly around a **Blueprint** spawn location (e.g. explosions randomly firing off around the player or at a location randomly).  |
| **5.6 Set Sound Based on Game Events** | Showcases how to completely change audio based on in-game events (e.g. ambient music is changed when triggering an alarm).  |
| **5.7 Synch Pitch to Moving Object** | Audio that adjusts in pitch automatically based on the location of an object. |
| **5.8 Play Sound from Bone Location** | Showcases how to attach audio to specific bone locations of a **Skeletal Mesh** and call them via **Anim Sequence** or **Blueprint** (e.g. footstep sounds synched with player movement, fire sounds emitting from the location of a body part, or dialogue sounds that appear to come from a characters mouth). |


### Surface Audio
The **Surface Audio** section covers how to generate sounds based on different types of **Materials** that you interact with. 
Whether your walking on wood floors or firing projectiles into glass, this section covers how to set up sounds for these types of scenarios. 

| Example | What's Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **6.1 Grass** | Audio sounds when shooting or walking on grass. |
| **6.2 Water** | Audio sounds when shooting or moving in water. |
| **6.3 Wood** | Audio sounds when shooting or walking on wood. |
