The **Audio** map located inside the Content Examples project is an excellent source to see firsthand how all the audio systems come together, while demonstrating them in bite-sized practical examples. This page is intended to give you an idea of what to expect from the audio Content Examples as well as where to find specific examples based on the audio system(s) you want to work with. Whether you are new to audio in Unreal Engine 4 or need a refresher course, this map will provide an excellent foundation.


## Audio Map

![](contentExamplesStarterMap.png)(w:640)

<!---
The **Audio** map gives you the core concepts for using audio in Unreal Engine 4. This map covers many topics including the different types of audio assets and how to manipulate them to produce different effects based on your needs. Whether you are new to audio in Unreal Engine 4 or need a refresher course, this map will provide an excellent foundation. 
--->
| Example | What is Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **1.1 AmbientSound Actor** | Audio that plays as a one-off event. |
| **1.2 AmbientSound Looping** | Audio that continuously plays until told to stop. |
| **1.3 AmbientSound Spatialize** | Audio that plays from the location of the sound. |
| **1.4 AmbientSound Attenuation** | Audio that plays from the sound's location and gets louder or softer based on distance to the sound. |
| **1.5 Attenuation with Low Pass Filter (LPF)** | Audio that plays from the sound's location and becomes more muffled the further the player is from the sound.  |
| **1.6 Attenuation Shapes** | Audio that plays from the sounds location within defined shapes (e.g. Sphere, Capsule, Box or Cone shapes). |
| **1.7 Shared Attenuation Settings** | Showcases a Sound Attenuation asset that affects the Attenuation of multiple Sound Actors. |
| **1.8 AmbientSound Actor using SoundCues** | Showcases how a Sound Cue can be used instead of a Sound Wave to create more complex sounds or to mix multiple sounds into one. |
| **1.9 Audio Volume** | Audio is affected by an Audio Volume where its effects can only be heard when the player is inside the volume (e.g. Dialogue plays and sounds as if you are in an auditorium when inside the volume. When outside, dialogue plays normally). |
| **1.10 Audio Volume using Ambient Zone** | Two sounds are affected by an Ambient Zone where one sound is placed inside an Audio Volume and the other is not. The inside sound is quiet while outside the Audio Volume but louder when inside, while the outside sound is quiet when inside the Audio Volume and louder while standing outside it (e.g. audio when moving from an indoor to outdoor environment at night). |

<!--
### Sound Cue Node Usage
The **Sound Cue Node Usage** section covers more in-depth usage of the **Sound Cue Editor** including: combining multiple **Sound Waves**, selective **Attenuation**, **Random** and **Delayed** playback of **Sound Waves**, and **Modulation**. 

| Example | What's Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **2.1 Mixer** | Two separate sounds fed through a **Mixer** node to produce a combined audio effect (e.g. ambient sounds with dripping water).  |
| **2.2 Attenuation** | A combination of two sounds with separate **Attenuation** settings where the falloff of each sound is independent of one another (e.g. audio effect from 2.1, however dripping water gets quieter the further you move away while ambient remains). |
| **2.3 Modulator** | Audio that plays back at a random volume or pitch based on its Min/Max settings (e.g. a dog that barks at a different pitch each time it's triggered). |
| **2.4 Random** | Randomly select a non-looping sound for playback each time the **Sound Cue** is triggered (e.g. a different bird call is played each time it is triggered). |
| **2.5 Delay + Looping** | Randomly select a non-looping sound for playback that repeats and has a delay between each playback (e.g. different bird calls are played and looped randomly with a delay between each sound). |


### Reverb + Ambient Zone Usage
The **Reverb + Ambient Zone Usage** section covers a how to use an **Audio Volume** and **Reverb Effect**, along with sound assets to produce dialogue that sounds as if you are standing in an auditorium. This section also covers how to use **Ambient Zones** and **Sound Classes** to generate interior/exterior sounds that play together where the volumes adjust based on whether you are inside or out. 

| Example | What's Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **3.1 Reverb** | Audio is affected by an **Audio Volume** where its effects can only be heard when the player is inside the volume (e.g. Dialogue plays inside a building and sounds like an auditorium. When outside, dialogue plays normally). |
| **3.2 Ambient Zone** | Two sounds are affected by an **Ambient Zone** where one sound is placed inside an **Audio Volume** and the other is not. The inside sound is quite while outside the **Audio Volume** but louder when inside, while the outside sound is quite when inside the **Audio Volume** and louder while standing outside it (e.g. audio when moving from an indoor to outdoor environment at night). |


### Ambient Showcase
The **Ambient Showcase** provides additional usage examples and illustrates how to use the four **Attenuation Shapes**, using audio in **Blueprints** to create rotating and moving sounds with **Attenuation**, and advanced usages of **Audio Volumes** and **Ambient Zones**. 

| Example | What's Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **4.1 Ambient Zone with Box Attenuation** | Showcases audio with **Attenuation** and an **Ambient Zone** inside a box-shaped room (e.g. entering the cockpit of an idle airplane). |
| **4.2 Rotating Cone Attenuation** | Audio is attached to a rotating object where the sound fades in/out based on it's location to the player (e.g. a rotating scanner device) |
| **4.3 Moving Sphere Attenuation** | Audio is attached to an object that moves forwards/backwards where the sound fades in/out based on it's location to the player and is adjusted based on that distance (e.g. a swarm of bees moving towards/away from you). |
| **4.4 Ambient Zone with Sphere Attenuation** | Showcases audio with **Attenuation** and an **Ambient Zone** inside a spherical room (e.g. the ambient machine noise of a mainframe or server room). |
| **4.5 Ambient Zone with Capsule Attenuation** | Showcases audio with **Attenuation** and an **Ambient Zone** inside a capsule-shaped room (e.g. exiting or entering a moving train car). |
| **4.6 Reverb + Ambient Zone with Cone Attenuation** | Showcases audio with **Attention**, **Reverb**, and an **Ambient Zone** inside a conical room (e.g. several sounds and dialogue come together to form a science fiction type setting). |


## Audio_Advanced Map

![](contentExamplesHeader.png)(w:640)

The **Audio_Advanced** map builds off the examples given in the **Starter Map** and demonstrates how to get the most out of the audio system in Unreal Engine 4. 
It offers more in-depth coverage of using audio in **Blueprints** and advanced **Sound Cue Node**, **Sound Class**, and **Sound Mix** usage samples. Using audio in **Matinee** and generating **Surface Sounds** are also covered in this map.

### Blueprint Sound Node Usage
The **Blueprint Sound Node Usage** section covers many topics including how to play a sound at a specific location or attached to an **Actor**, how to start/stop a sound through **Blueprints**, and how to create and add **Reverb** to a sound without using a volume.

| Example | What's Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **1.1 Play Sound at Location** | Audio that plays from a set location (e.g. audio is heard playing from the location of a spark effect). |
| **1.2 Play Sound Attached** | Audio that plays and is attached to a moving Actor (e.g. audio is heard emitting and attached to a moving chicken). |
| **1.3 Play/Stop** | Showcases, through **Blueprints**, how to start or stop a looping sound. |
| **1.4 Fade In/Fade Out** | Showcases, through **Blueprints**, how to add a fade in or fade out effect to a sound. |
| **1.5 Adjust Volume** | Showcases, through **Blueprints**, how to adjust the volume of a sound that is currently playing. |
| **1.6 Set Pitch Multiplier** | Showcases, through **Blueprints**, how to change the pitch of a sound that is currently playing. |
| **1.7 Set Sound** | Showcases, through **Blueprints**, how to change the sound asset assigned to an audio component. |
| **1.8 Is Playing** | Showcases, through **Blueprints**, how to have an audio component return it's current **Playing** or **Not Playing** condition. |
| **1.9 Activate/Deactivate Reverb Effect** | Showcases, through **Blueprints**, how to activate **Reverb Effects** without using an **Audio Volume**. |

### Advanced Sound Cue Node Usage
The **Advanced Sound Cue Node Usage** demos are setup using **Blueprints** and covers examples on how to have a sound adjust its volume or pitch over time, more advanced cross-fading techniques, using float values to drive effects, using Booleans inside of **Sound Cues**, and **Doppler** effects. 

| Example | What's Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **2.1 Enveloper** | Audio that changes its volume and pitch over time (e.g. a dying police car siren). |
| **2.2 Oscillator** | Showcases how to have audio that moves back-and-forth between volume, pitch, and frequency settings. |
| **2.3 Group Control** | Showcases how to play different sounds based on the number of identical **Sound Cues** playing (e.g. one soldier marching versus a platoon of soldiers). |
| **2.4 Branch** | Showcases how to setup a Boolean inside a **Sound Cue** and play a sound based on its condition (e.g. a police siren that only plays if a revving engine is playing). |
| **2.5 Wave Param** | Showcases how to specify a sound within a **Sound Cue** that can be swapped out at anytime through **Blueprints**. |
| **2.6 Continuous Modulator** | Audio that modulates based on an incoming float value (e.g. a car engine that gets louder or softer based on speed). |
| **2.7 Crossfade By Param** | Showcases how to have multiple sounds that fade in or out based on an incoming float value.  |
| **2.8 Crossfade By Distance** | Showcases how to play different sounds that fade in or out based on the **Sound Cue's** distance from the player. |
| **2.9 Doppler** | Showcases how to add a **Doppler** effect to a sound in motion (e.g. a jet engine sound based on distance from the player). |


### Sound Class + Sound Mix Usage
The **Sound Class + Sound Mix Usage** section demonstrates how the two are different as well as how they work together. 
A prime example is given showing how to use **Sound Mixes** to combine music, audio, and combat sounds as well as how to focus in on sounds by pushing or popping them. 
There are also examples on **Passive Sound Mixes** which activate and deactivate automatically as well as using Low/High Pass Filters, or how to apply a radio transmission effect to your audio. 

| Example | What's Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **3.1 Set Base Sound Mix** | Showcases how to set up a **Sound Mix** containing multiple **Sound Cues** (e.g. basic mix of dialogue, music, and background sounds) |
| **3.2 Dialogue Focused Sound Mix** | While playing audio from 3.1, this illustrates how to push/pop the **Dialogue** so that it is louder/softer than the other sounds. |
| **3.3 Music Focused Sound Mix** | While playing audio from 3.1, this illustrates how to push/pop the **Music** so that it is louder/softer than the other sounds. |
| **3.4 Background Focused Sound Mix** | While playing audio from 3.1, this illustrates how to push/pop the **Background** combat sounds so that they are louder/softer than the other sounds. |
| **3.5 Clear Sound Mix Modifiers** | While playing audio from 3.1 and activating 3.2, 3.3, or 3.4 to focus on a sound, this illustrates how to clear all currently pushed **Sound Mixes**. |
| **3.6 Passive Sound Mix** | Showcases how to have **Sound Mixes** activate and deactivate automatically based on **Sound Classes* (e.g. whenever a sound is played, other sounds automatically adjust). |
| **3.7 EQ** | Showcases how to apply equalizer effects to a sound that is playing by using Low/High Pass Filters by pushing/popping them in **Blueprints**. |
| **3.8 Radio Filter** | Showcases how to apply a radio transmission effect to a sound.  |


### Matinee Sound Usage
The **Matinee Sound Usage** section covers how to use sound within **Matinee** sequences. This includes attaching sounds to Static Meshes or the camera, using the **Sound Track** in **Matinee**, and using **Volume** and **Pitch** curves. 

| Example | What's Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **4.1 Attach Sound Actor to Static Mesh** | Audio that plays while attached to a Static Mesh Actor that moves around in a **Matinee** sequence. |
| **4.2 Attach Sound Actor to Camera** | Audio that plays from the location of a camera inside a **Matinee** sequence. |
| **4.3 Sound Track** | Showcases how to add audio to a **Matinee** by using the **Sound Track** and attach it to an Actor in the scene (e.g. dialogue that plays from the location of a character who walks around in a scene).|
| **4.4 Volume and Pitch Curves** | Showcases how to fade **Sound Tracks** in and out using **Volume** and **Pitch** curves (e.g. adjusting the music pitch to account for a slow-motion sequence).  |


### Blueprint Sound Node Showcases
The **Blueprint Sound Node Showcase** provides more tailored examples of using the audio systems to bring to life effects like fireworks or objects like a flickering fluorescent light. 
There are also examples showing how to dynamically alter the audio experience based on game events (like triggering an alarm), play sounds at random locations, modifying the pitch of a sound based on its movement, as well as attaching and playing sound from a specific location of a character.

| Example | What's Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **5.1 Volume Ducking** | Audio that plays inside an encapsulated room. **Reverb** effects are altered based on whether or not the player is inside the room with the door closed or open. |
| **5.2 Play Sound at Particle Collision** | Audio is played at the location of particle collision (e.g. a bouncing particle effect that emits sound when colliding). |
| **5.3 Play Sound at Particle Spawn and Particle Death** | Audio that plays at a particle's spawn location with different audio that plays at its destroy location (e.g. fireworks flying in the air then exploding). |
| **5.4 Set Volume Multiplier With Timeline Driven Float** | Audio that adjusts its volume based on a float value defined by a **Timeline** curve (e.g. a flickering fluorescent light). |
| **5.5 Play Sounds at Random Locations Around an Object** | Showcases audio that plays randomly around the player pawn. Also shows audio that plays randomly around a **Blueprint** spawn location (e.g. explosions randomly firing off around the player or at a location randomly).  |
| **5.6 Set Sound Based on Game Events** | Showcases how to completely change audio based on in-game events (e.g. ambient music is changed when triggering an alarm).  |
| **5.7 Synch Pitch to Moving Object** | Audio that adjusts in pitch automatically based on the location of an object. |
| **5.8 Play Sound from Bone Location** | Showcases how to attach audio to specific bone locations of a **Skeletal Mesh** and call them via **Anim Sequence** or **Blueprint** (e.g. footstep sounds synched with player movement, fire sounds emitting from the location of a body part, or dialogue sounds that appear to come from a characters mouth). |


### Surface Audio
The **Surface Audio** section covers how to generate sounds based on different types of **Materials** that you interact with. 
Whether your walking on wood floors or firing projectiles into glass, this section covers how to set up sounds for these types of scenarios. 

| Example | What's Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **6.1 Grass** | Audio sounds when shooting or walking on grass. |
| **6.2 Water** | Audio sounds when shooting or moving in water. |
| **6.3 Wood** | Audio sounds when shooting or walking on wood. |
| **6.4 Concrete** | Audio sounds when shooting or walking on concrete. |
| **6.5 Metal** | Audio sounds when shooting or walking on metal. |
| **6.6 Glass** | Audio sounds when shooting or walking on glass. |
