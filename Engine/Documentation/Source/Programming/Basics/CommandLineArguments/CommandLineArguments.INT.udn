Title: Command-Line Arguments
Crumbs: %ROOT%, Engine
Description:Collection of arguments that can be passed to the engine's executable to configure options controlling how it runs.
Version: 4.9


[TOC (start:2 end:3)]





**Command-Line Arguments** are strings of keywords that you can pass when running the executable via the command line or a shortcut to the executable. Their purpose is to customize the manner in which the engine runs to suit the needs of the developer or user. This can be as simple as causing the editor to run instead of the game, or it can be much more involved such as starting up the game with a certain map running at a specified resolution and framerate while dumping out each frame to individual image files. 



## Modes

These arguments are used to force the main editor executable (`UE4Editor.exe`) to run as the game or a server using uncooked content. 

[REGION:note]
These commands are not case sensitive.

Example:

      
	UE4Editor.exe -game
      
| Argument | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| -game | Launch the game using uncooked content. |
| -server | Run the game as a server using uncooked content. |


## URL Parameters

URLs can be passed to the executable to force the game to load a specific map upon startup. These can also be used in conjunction with the SERVER or EDITOR modes to run the editor or a server with a specific map. Passing a URL is optional, but must immediately follow the executable name or any mode switch if one is present.

A URL consists of two parts: a map name or server IP address and a series of optional additional parameters. A map name can be any map located within the Maps directory. The inclusion of a file extension (i.e., `.umap`) here is optional. To load a map not found in the Maps directory, an absolute path or a relative path from the Maps directory can be used. In this case, the inclusion of the file extension is mandatory. The server IP address is a standard 4-part IP address consisting of 4 values between 0 and 255 separated by periods. The additional options are specified by appending them to the map name or server IP address. Each option is prefaced by a '?', and can set a value with '='. Starting an option with '-' will remove that option from the cached URL options.

*Examples:*

	MyGame.exe /Game/Maps/MyMap
	UE4Editor.exe MyGame.uproject /Game/Maps/MyMap?game=MyGameInfo -game
	UE4Editor.exe MyGame.uproject /Game/Maps/MyMap?listen -server
	MyGame.exe 127.0.0.1
      
### General Options

| Argument | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| game | Tells the engine what GameInfo class to use (overriding default). |
| name | Player name to use. |

### Server Options

| Argument | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| listen | Specify server as a listen server. |
| bIsLanMatch | Set whether multiplayer game is on the local network (e.g. `bIsLanMatch=0`). |
| bIsFromInvite | Specifies that the player joining was invited. |
| spectatoronly | Start the game in spectator mode. |

## Switches

These arguments can be passed to either the game or the editor, depending on the specific keyword and its intended usage. Some arguments are plain switches (i.e., -UNATTENDED) while others are setting switches which are "key=value" pairs (i.e., -LOG=MyLog.txt). These commands are not case sensitive. The syntax for passing plain switches is to preface each argument with a minus '-' and then the argument immediately afterward. Setting switches need no leading '-', with the exception of the server switches.

*Example:*

      
	UE4Editor.exe -silent LOG=MyLog.txt

Another command line argument may be used to temporarily override which INIs are loaded by the game or editor. For example, if a custom 'MyGame.ini' is to be used instead of 'UDKGame.ini', the argument would be (i.e., -GAMEINI=MyGame.ini). This table lists the arguments used to override the different INI files used in UE4:
