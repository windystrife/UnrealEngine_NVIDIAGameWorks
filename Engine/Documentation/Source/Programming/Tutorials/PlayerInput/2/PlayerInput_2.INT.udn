There are two types of input mappings: Action and Axis.

* **Action Mappings** are useful to think of as "yes or no" inputs, like the buttons on a mouse or joystick. They report when they are pressed, released, double-clicked, or held down for a short time. Discrete actions like jumping, shooting, or interacting with objects are good candidates for this type of mapping.
* **Axis Mappings** are continuous - think of them as "how much" inputs, like the stick on a joystick, or the position of a mouse cursor. They report their value every frame, even if they're not moving. Things with magnitude or direction, such as walking, looking around, and steering a vehicle are usually handled this way.

While input mappings can be defined directly in code, the usual method is to define them in the **Unreal Engine** editor, so that's how we'll do it in this tutorial.

1. In the **Unreal Engine** editor, under the **Edit** dropdown menu, we'll click the **Project Settings** option.

1. From there, we'll select the **Input** option from the **Engine** section on the left. We can then expand the **Bindings** category that appears on the right, and add one **Action Mapping** and two **Axis Mappings**.
	
	The plus sign next to the **Action Mapping** or **Axis Mapping** section headings will add a new mapping. The expander arrow on the left can be used to show or hide our mappings.
	To add an additional input to a mapping, click the plus sign next to that mapping. Following are the mappings and inputs we will need. Take note of the negative values for the S and A inputs.

	| ----- | ----- | ----- |
	| Action Mapping | | |
	| Grow | Space Bar | |

	| ----- | ----- | ----- |
	| Axis Mapping | | |
	| MoveX | W | 1.0 |
	|  | S | -1.0 |
	| MoveY | A | -1.0 |
	|  | D | 1.0 |

1. Now that our input is configured, let's set up a MyPawn in our level. The** MyPawn** class will appear in our **Content Browser**, and is ready to be dragged into the **Level Editor**.

1. One more step is needed to set up our MyPawn. We'll need to give it a **Static Mesh** so that we can see it in the game. We can do this by selecting the MyPawn we just created, selecting the component called **OurVisibleComponent (Inherited)** in the **Details Panel**, and assigning an asset to it through the dropdown box in the **Static Mesh** category. For this tutorial, **Shape_Cylinder** is a good asset to use.

1. We can now save our level and return to **Visual Studio** to write code that will make the MyPawn we placed react to the inputs we defined.

We're now ready to finish coding our MyPawn class in **Visual Studio**.
