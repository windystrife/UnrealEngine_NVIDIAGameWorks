1. Our countdown timer is currently hard-coded to use a value of 3 seconds. It would be more useful if we could set the countdown time to any value we want in the editor, and this is easy to do. In **Visual Studio**, we can open Countdown.h and find the line that says:

		int32 CountdownTime;

	In order to expose this variable to **Unreal Engine**, we need to make it a **UPROPERTY**. This enables the engine to preserve the value of the variable when launching the game or loading a saved level. The UPROPERTY tag, with empty parentheses, is added right above the variable it affects:

		UPROPERTY()
		int32 CountdownTime;

	UPROPERTY supports arguments that change how **Unreal Engine** will use the variable. Since we want our variable to be editable, we can add the **EditAnywhere** argument:

		UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
		int32 CountdownTime;

	[![](ExposingVariable.png)](ExposingVariable.png)

	We can also add a comment to our variable in C++, and our comment will become the description of the variable in the **Unreal Editor**, like this:

		//How long, in seconds, the countdown will run
		UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
		int32 CountdownTime;

	[REGION:tip]There is a lot more we can do with UPROPERTY, and looking into other arguments such as **BlueprintReadWrite** and **Category** might be good next steps, but we have all that we need at the moment.[/REGION]
	
	When we return to the **Unreal Editor** and press **Compile**, our variable will appear in the **Details Panel** for the ACountdown we placed earlier, and we can test out different timer values by changing this number and pressing **Play**.

1. In addition to changing the value of the timer, let's also enable non-programming developers to change what happens when the timer is up. In **Visual Studio**, we'll open Countdown.h and find the following line:

		void CountdownHasFinished();

	We can expose this function to the **Unreal Engine** by making it a **UFUNCTION**, like this:

		UFUNCTION()
		void CountdownHasFinished();

	[REGION:note]
	Just like the UPROPERTY macro, we need to provide information about what can be done with it in order to enable more features and access for non-programming developers. There are three options to consider:
	
	1. **BlueprintCallable** functions are written in C++ and can be called from the **Blueprint Graph**, but cannot be changed or overridden without editing C++ code. Functions marked this way are usually features that have been programmed for non-programmer use, but that are not supposed to be changed or wouldn't make sense to change. An easy example of this would be any kind of math function.

	1. **BlueprintImplementableEvent** functions are set up in a C++ header (.h) file, but the body of the function is written entirely in the Blueprint Graph, not in C++. These are usually created to give a non-programmer the ability to create custom reactions to special situations that have no expected default action or standard behavior. An example of this might be an event that happens when a powerup touches the player's ship in a spaceship game.

	1. **BlueprintNativeEvent** functions are like a combination of BlueprintCallable and BlueprintImplementableEvent functions. They have default behaviors programmed in C++, but these can be supplemented or replaced by overriding in the Blueprint Graph. When programming these, the C++ code always goes in a virtual function with _Implementation added to the end of the name, as shown below. This is the most flexible option, so we will use it for this tutorial.
	[/REGION]

	To grant non-programmers the ability to call our C++ function and to override it with **Blueprints**, we need to make the following changes to Countdown.h:

		UFUNCTION(BlueprintNativeEvent)
		void CountdownHasFinished();
		virtual void CountdownHasFinished_Implementation();

	Then, in Countdown.cpp, we will need to change the line that says:

		void ACountdown::CountdownHasFinished()

	To:

		void ACountdown::CountdownHasFinished_Implementation()

----

We have now made a variable and a function accessible to, and alterable by, non-programmers, while providing our own default value and functionality in C++. To see how a non-programmer might use this, we'll make a Blueprint extension of our ACountdown class and modify it ourselves.
