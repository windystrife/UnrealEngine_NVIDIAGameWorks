[REGION:tip]This section of the tutorial involves using **Blueprints** to extend the functionality of C++ classes. However, it is only intended as a test that our C++ code was written correctly, not as a Blueprint tutorial. For a proper introduction to Blueprints, we recommend the [%Engine\Blueprints\QuickStart:title%](Engine\Blueprints\QuickStart).[/REGION]

1. To change the behavior of our ACountdown instance, called Countdown1, in the editor, we must first make an editable Blueprint version of it. To do this, we can select it from the **World Outliner** and click the **Blueprint/Add Script** button in the **Details Panel**.

	[![](AddScript.png)](AddScript.png)

	From there, we can provide a path and name for the Blueprint asset that will contain our modified ACountdown class.

	[![](SelectBlueprintPath.png)](SelectBlueprintPath.png)

	This will create a new asset that represents a Blueprint version of Countdown1. It will also replace Countdown1 with an instance of this new Blueprint, so that changes we make to the Blueprint will affect Countdown1 in the game.

1. The **Unreal Editor** will automatically take us to our new asset in the **Content Browser**, and we can **Right-click** it and choose "Edit..." to modify its **Blueprint Graph**, **Component** hierararchy, and **Default Values**.

	[![](BlueprintInContentBrowser.png)](BlueprintInContentBrowser.png)

	[![](EditBlueprint.png)](EditBlueprint.png)

1. Functions and events can be found in the **Event Graph** tab, so we'll select that first.

	[![](SelectEventGraph.png)](SelectEventGraph.png)

	Then, by **Right-clicking** anywhere in the **Event Graph** window, we can add our **CountdownHasFinished** function as an event node to define its behavior.

	[![](SelectEvent.png)](SelectEvent.png)

1. We can now add any additional functionality we would like by left-clicking and dragging off of the white (execution) pin on the right side of our new node.

	[![](DragExecPin.png)](DragExecPin.png)

	When we release the left mouse button, we will be asked what function or event we would like to execute. For this tutorial, let's spawn a **Particle System** when the countdown finishes. We'll want a **Spawn Emitter At Location** node, so select that from the list. It can save time to type a partial phrase, like spawn loc, into the search field. We can then left-click and drag the yellow "Location" pin and attach it to a **Get Actor Location** function.

	[![](GetActorLocation.png)](GetActorLocation.png)

	Now we just need to select what effect we'd like to see. By clicking Select Asset under Emitter Template, we can get a list of appropriate effect assets. P_Explosion is a good one, so we'll pick that.

	[![](SelectParticle.png)](SelectParticle.png)

1. Click the **Compile** button at the top left of the **Blueprint Editor** to save the changes.

1. If we press **Play** now, we'll see our countdown take place, and our explosion will happen when our countdown number hits zero.

	[![](Explosion_Zero.png)](Explosion_Zero.png)

	However, we programmed our countdown to say GO! at the end, not 0. This is no longer happening because we have completely replaced our C++ functionality with our **Blueprint** visual scripting. This is not what we intended to do in this case, so we need to add a call to the C++ version of this function, which can be done by right-clicking the **Countdown Has Finished** node and selecting **Add call to parent function** from the context menu.

	[![](CallToParent_Menu.png)](CallToParent_Menu.png)

	When this is done, a node labeled **Parent: Countdown Has Finished** will be placed in the **Event Graph**. The typical place to connect a parent node is directly to the event node, which is what we will do here. This is not required, though, as the parent-call node is like any other and can be called anywhere we like, even multiple times.

	[![](CallToParent_ConnectPins.png)](CallToParent_ConnectPins.png)

	Note that this will replace the connection to **Spawn Emitter At Location**, so we'll need to connect our **Parent: Countdown Has Finished** node's right side (outgoing) execution pin to it or it won't run.

	[![](CallToParent_FixPins.png)](CallToParent_FixPins.png)

	Now when we run our game, we should see both the word GO! (from our C++ code) and an explosion (from our Blueprint Graph) after the countdown finishes!
