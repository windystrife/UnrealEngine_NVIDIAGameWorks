%Steps%

Using what you have learned, try to do the following:

* Attach a Camera to a moving Actor to create a crane or dolly shot.
* Use a single [Array](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/TArrays) variable to store your cameras, instead of CameraOne and CameraTwo, so you can go through a sequence of any number of cameras, instead of just two.
* Instead of using [Actor](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Actors) pointers to store your cameras, create a [Structure](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Reference/Structs) that holds the pointer, as well as time before changing the view, and blend time to the new view.

As for the specifics covered in this tutorial:

* For more information on Cameras and ways to control them, see the [Camera](Gameplay/Framework/Camera) framework page, or try the [%Programming/Tutorials/PlayerCamera:title%](Programming/Tutorials/PlayerCamera) tutorial.
* For further tutorials, see the [%Programming/Tutorials:title%](Programming/Tutorials) page.
