[REGION:tip]If you are new to **Unreal Engine 4**, you might want to read our [%Programming\QuickStart:title% tutorial](Programming\QuickStart) first. For this tutorial, we will assume you are familiar with creating a project, adding C++ code to it, compiling your code, and adding **Components** to **Actors** in the **Unreal Engine** editor.[/REGION]

1. We will begin by creating a new, Basic Code project, with starter content, named HowTo_PlayerCamera. We'll want to create a custom **Pawn** class, so let's do that first. For this tutorial, we'll use the name PawnWithCamera for our new Pawn class.

	[![](NamePawnClass.png)](NamePawnClass.png)

1. Next, in **Visual Studio**, we should open PawnWithCamera.h and add the following code to the bottom of our class definition:

		protected:
			UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
			USpringArmComponent* OurCameraSpringArm;
			UCameraComponent* OurCamera;

	We will use these variables to create a **SpringArmComponent** with a **CameraComponent** attached to the end. Spring arms are a good, simple way to attach cameras (or other Components) so that they're not overly rigid and feel more fluid as they move.

1. After that, we actually need to create our Components in our constructor. Add the following code to PawnWithCamera.cpp inside of **APawnWithCamera::APawnWithCamera**:

		//Create our components
		RootComponent = CreateDefaultSubobject<USceneComponent>(TEXT("RootComponent"));
		OurCameraSpringArm = CreateDefaultSubobject<USpringArmComponent>(TEXT("CameraSpringArm"));
		OurCameraSpringArm->SetupAttachment(RootComponent);
		OurCameraSpringArm->SetRelativeLocationAndRotation(FVector(0.0f, 0.0f, 50.0f), FRotator(-60.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f));
		OurCameraSpringArm->TargetArmLength = 400.f;
		OurCameraSpringArm->bEnableCameraLag = true;
		OurCameraSpringArm->CameraLagSpeed = 3.0f;

	This creates a basic, empty **SceneComponent** as the root of our Component hierarchy, then creates and attaches a SpringArmComponent to it. The **Spring Arm** is then set at a default pitch of -60 degrees (that is, looking 60 degrees downward) and a position of 50 units above the root. We also establish a few values specific to the SpringArmComponent class that will determine its length and the smoothness of its motion. With that finished, we simply need to create and attach a CameraComponent to the socket on the end of the SpringArmComponent, as follows:

		OurCamera = CreateDefaultSubobject<UCameraComponent>(TEXT("GameCamera"));
		OurCamera->SetupAttachment(OurCameraSpringArm, USpringArmComponent::SocketName);

1. Finally, we can set our Pawn to be controlled by the default, local player automatically upon being spawned by adding this piece of code:

		//Take control of the default Player
		AutoPossessPlayer = EAutoReceiveInput::Player0;

----

We now have a simple Pawn that will allow us to control our camera comfortably. Next, we'll configure our input in the **Unreal Engine** editor and create code that reacts to it.
