%Steps%

Currently, our projectiles:

*	Live forever (they never disappear from the Scene Outliner)
*	Don't collide with other objects in the world

During this step, we're going to set up projectile collision and lifetime.

## Limiting the Projectile's Life Span

1.	Locate the `FPSProjectile` class CPP file in the **Solution Explorer** and open `FPSProjectile.cpp`.

1.	Add the following code to the `FPSProjectile` constructor to set the projectile's lifespan:

		// Die after 3 seconds.
		InitialLifeSpan = 3.0f;

## Editing the Projectile's Collision Settings

Unreal Engine comes packaged with several preset collision chanels; however, the engine also provides customizable channels that game projects can use.

1. Open **Project Settings** and select **Collision** to customize a collision channel.

1.	Select **New Object Channel...** to create a new collision channel. Name your new collision channel "Projectile" and make sure that the **Default Response** is set to **Block** before clicking **Accept**.

1.	Select **New...** under **Preset** and name your new profile "Projectile" as well. Refer to the following image to set your collision presets.

	This collision profile specifies that the projectile will be blocked by `Static Actors`, `Dynamic Actors`, `Actors` simulating `Physics`, `Vehicles`, and `Destructible Actors`. Also, 
	this collision profile specifies that the projectile overlaps `Pawns`.

## Using the New Collision Channel's Settings

1.	Locate the `FPSProjectile` class CPP file in the **Solution Explorer** and open `FPSProjectile.cpp`.

1.	In the `FPSProjectile` constructor, add the following line after the creation of `CollisionComponent`:

		CollisionComponent->BodyInstance.SetCollisionProfileName(TEXT("Projectile"));

1.	`FPSProjectile.cpp` should now look like the following:

		// Fill out your copyright notice in the Description page of Project Settings.
		
		#include "FPSProject.h"
		#include "FPSProjectile.h"
		
		// Sets default values
		AFPSProjectile::AFPSProjectile()
		{
		 	// Set this actor to call Tick() every frame.  You can turn this off to improve performance if you don't need it.
			PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = true;
		
			// Use a sphere as a simple collision representation.
			CollisionComponent = CreateDefaultSubobject<USphereComponent>(TEXT("SphereComponent"));
			CollisionComponent->BodyInstance.SetCollisionProfileName(TEXT("Projectile"));

			// Set the sphere's collision radius.
			CollisionComponent->InitSphereRadius(15.0f);
			// Set the root component to be the collision component.
			RootComponent = CollisionComponent;
		
			// Use this component to drive this projectile's movement.
			ProjectileMovementComponent = CreateDefaultSubobject<UProjectileMovementComponent>(TEXT("ProjectileMovementComponent"));
			ProjectileMovementComponent->SetUpdatedComponent(CollisionComponent);
			ProjectileMovementComponent->InitialSpeed = 3000.0f;
			ProjectileMovementComponent->MaxSpeed = 3000.0f;
			ProjectileMovementComponent->bRotationFollowsVelocity = true;
			ProjectileMovementComponent->bShouldBounce = true;
			ProjectileMovementComponent->Bounciness = 0.3f;
		
			// Die after 3 seconds.
			InitialLifeSpan = 3.0f;
		}
		
		// Called when the game starts or when spawned
		void AFPSProjectile::BeginPlay()
		{
			Super::BeginPlay();
			
		}
		
		// Called every frame
		void AFPSProjectile::Tick( float DeltaTime )
		{
			Super::Tick( DeltaTime );
		
		}
		
		// Function that initializes the projectile's velocity in the shoot direction.
		void AFPSProjectile::FireInDirection(const FVector& ShootDirection)
		{
			ProjectileMovementComponent->Velocity = ShootDirection * ProjectileMovementComponent->InitialSpeed;
		}

1.	Save `FPSProjectile.cpp` in Visual Studio.

1.	Locate **FPSProject** in the **Solution Explorer**.

1.	Right-click on **FPSProject** and select **Build** to compile your project.
