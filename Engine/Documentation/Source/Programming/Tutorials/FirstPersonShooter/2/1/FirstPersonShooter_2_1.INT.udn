%Steps%

During this step, we're going to make a new character using the engine's Character base class. The Character class (derived from the Pawn class) has built-in functionality for bipedal movement; such as walking, running, and jumping.

## Adding a Character Class

Although you can manually add \*.h and \*.cpp files to your Visual Studio solution, it's good practice to use the C++ Class Wizard to add new classes to your project. By using the C++ Class Wizard, the engine creates header and source templates that set-up Unreal specific macros for you.

1.	In the File menu, select **New C++ Class...** to choose your new parent class.

1.	The **Choose Parent Class** menu will open. Scroll down, select **Character** as the parent class and click **Next**.

1.	Name the new class "FPSCharacter," then click **Create**.

	[REGION:note]
	Now that you've created your FPSCharacter class, you can switch to **Visual Studio** to add code to your newly created class. `FPSCharacter.h` and `FPSCharacter.cpp` will be opened for you and Unreal Engine will automatically compile and reload the code for your new class.

## Verifying the Character Class

1.	In the **Solution Explorer**, expand **FPSProject > Source > FPSProject**.

	![](ExpandedSolutionExplorer.png)

1.	Double-click `FPSCharacter.cpp` to open the implementation file for your **FPSCharacter** class.

1.	Add the following lines of code in the `BeginPlay()` function to verify that `FPSCharacter` class is being used:

		if (GEngine)
		{
			// Put up a debug message for five seconds. The -1 "Key" value (first argument) indicates that we will never need to update or refresh this message.
			GEngine->AddOnScreenDebugMessage(-1, 5.0f, FColor::Red, TEXT("We are using FPSCharacter."));
		}

1.	`FPSCharacter.cpp` should now look like the following:

		// Fill out your copyright notice in the Description page of Project Settings.
		
		#include "FPSProject.h"
		#include "FPSCharacter.h"
				
		// Sets default values
		AFPSCharacter::AFPSCharacter()
		{
		 	// Set this character to call Tick() every frame.  You can turn this off to improve performance if you don't need it.
			PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = true;
		
		}
		
		// Called when the game starts or when spawned
		void AFPSCharacter::BeginPlay()
		{
			Super::BeginPlay();
			
			if (GEngine)
			{
				// Put up a debug message for five seconds. The -1 "Key" value (first argument) indicates that we will never need to update or refresh this message.
				GEngine->AddOnScreenDebugMessage(-1, 5.0f, FColor::Red, TEXT("We are using FPSCharacter."));
			}
		}
		
		// Called every frame
		void AFPSCharacter::Tick( float DeltaTime )
		{
			Super::Tick( DeltaTime );
		
		}
		
		// Called to bind functionality to input
		void AFPSCharacter::SetupPlayerInputComponent(class UInputComponent* PlayerInputComponent)
		{
			Super::SetupPlayerInputComponent(PlayerInputComponent);
		
		}

1.	Save the `FPSCharacter` CPP file in Visual Studio.

1.	Locate **FPSProject** in the **Solution Explorer**.

1.	Up until now, you've been compiling your project using the editor's **Build** button. During this step, you're going to gain experience compiling code using Visual Studio's build feature. To compile your code from inside Visual Studio, right-click on **FPSProject** and select **Build** to compile your project.

1.	After the build finishes, open Unreal Editor to verify that your newly compiled **FPSCharacter** class is visible in the **Content Browser**.

## Extending your CPP FPS Character Class to Blueprints

Now is a good time to extend the CPP FPS Character class to Blueprints. Please feel free to go to our [](Gameplay/ClassCreation/CodeAndBlueprints) reference page to learn more about extending
C++ classes to Blueprints.

1.	Right-click the `FPSCharacter` class to open the **C++ Class Actions** menu.

	![](CPPClassActionsMenu.png)

1.	Click **Create Blueprint class based on FPSCharacter** to open the **Add Blueprint Class** dialog menu.

	![](CreateDerivedBPClass.png)

1.	Name your new Blueprint Class "BP_FPSCharacter" and choose the Blueprints folder before clicking the **Create Blueprint Class** button.

	![](AddBPClass.png)

1.	By now, you should have a newly created `BP_FPSCharacter` Blueprint Class located inside of the Blueprints folder.

1.	Make sure to save your `BP_FPSCharacter` Blueprint before closing the Blueprint Editor.

## Setting the Default Pawn Class

Now that we've successfully extended our newly modified Game Mode to Blueprints, we'll need to set our project to use `BP_FPSCharacter` as the default **Pawn** in this step.

1.	In the **Edit** menu, click on **Project Settings**.

1.	Under the **Project** heading on the left side of the **Project Settings** tab, click on **Maps & Modes**.

1.	Select **BP_FPSCharacter** in the **Default Pawn** dropdown menu.

	![](SettingFPSCharacter.png)

1.	Close the **Project Settings** menu.

1.	Click the **Play** button in the Level Editor Toolbar. "We are using FPSCharacter." should now be displayed in red text below "Hello World, this is FPSGameMode!" for five seconds in the upper left corner of the viewport.

	 If you're unable to move, you're using FPSCharacter as your Pawn correctly! Your new Character doesn't have any movement controls yet, so you won't be able to move around in the level.

1.	Before going to the next step, press the Escape key or click the **Stop** button in the Level Editor to exit Play in Editor (PIE) mode.
