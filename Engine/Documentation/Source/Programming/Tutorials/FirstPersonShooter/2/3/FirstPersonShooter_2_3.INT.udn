%Steps%

In this step, we're going to set-up our Player Input Component and implement the following functions in the `FPSCharacter` class:

*	`MoveForward`
*	`MoveRight`

## Movement Function Interfaces

Now that you've set-up Axis mappings for your `FPSCharacter`, you can switch to your project in Visual Studio.

1.	In `FPSCharacter.h`, add the following function declarations under `SetupPlayerInputComponent`.

		// Handles input for moving forward and backward.
		UFUNCTION()
		void MoveForward(float Value);
		
		// Handles input for moving right and left.
		UFUNCTION()
		void MoveRight(float Value);

	The `UFUNCTION` macro (located above each of these functions) makes the engine aware of these functions so that they can be included in serialization and other engine functionality.

1.	`FPSCharacter.h` should now look like the following:

		// Fill out your copyright notice in the Description page of Project Settings.
		
		#pragma once
		
		#include "GameFramework/Character.h"
		#include "FPSCharacter.generated.h"
		
		UCLASS()
		class FPSPROJECT_API AFPSCharacter : public ACharacter
		{
			GENERATED_BODY()
		
		public:
			// Sets default values for this character's properties
			AFPSCharacter();
		
		protected:
			// Called when the game starts or when spawned
			virtual void BeginPlay() override;
			
		public:
			// Called every frame
			virtual void Tick( float DeltaSeconds ) override;
		
			// Called to bind functionality to input
			virtual void SetupPlayerInputComponent(class UInputComponent* PlayerInputComponent) override;
		
			// Handles input for moving forward and backward.
			UFUNCTION()
			void MoveForward(float Value);
		
			// Handles input for moving right and left.
			UFUNCTION()
			void MoveRight(float Value);
			
		};

## Movement Function Implementations

In a typical FPS control scheme, the character's movement axes are relative to the camera. "Forward" movement means "the direction that the camera is pointing" and "right" means "to the right of the direction that the camera is pointing." You are going to use the `PlayerController` to get the character's control rotation. Also, your `MoveForward` function will ignore the pitch component of the control rotation and restrict your input to the XY plane so as to guarantee that your character will move along the ground while you are looking up or down.

1.	In `FPSCharacter.cpp`, add the following lines to the `SetupPlayerInputComponent` function under `Super::SetupPlayerInputComponent(PlayerInputComponent)`:

		// Called to bind functionality to input
		void AFPSCharacter::SetupPlayerInputComponent(class UInputComponent* PlayerInputComponent)
		{
			Super::SetupPlayerInputComponent(PlayerInputComponent);
			
			// Set up "movement" bindings.
			PlayerInputComponent->BindAxis("MoveForward", this, &AFPSCharacter::MoveForward);
			PlayerInputComponent->BindAxis("MoveRight", this, &AFPSCharacter::MoveRight);
		}

	[REGION:note]
	An `InputComponent` is a component that defines how to handle input data. An `InputComponent` can be attached to an actor that wants to receive input.
	[/REGION]

1.	Add the following `MoveForward` function definition in `FPSCharacter.cpp`.

		void AFPSCharacter::MoveForward(float Value)
		{
			// Find out which way is "forward" and record that the player wants to move that way.
			FVector Direction = FRotationMatrix(Controller->GetControlRotation()).GetScaledAxis(EAxis::X);
			AddMovementInput(Direction, Value);
		}

1.	Add the following `MoveRight` function definition in `FPSCharacter.cpp`.

		void AFPSCharacter::MoveRight(float Value)
		{
			// Find out which way is "right" and record that the player wants to move that way.
			FVector Direction = FRotationMatrix(Controller->GetControlRotation()).GetScaledAxis(EAxis::Y);
			AddMovementInput(Direction, Value);
		}

1.	`FPSCharacter.cpp` should now look like the following:

		// Fill out your copyright notice in the Description page of Project Settings.
		
		#include "FPSProject.h"
		#include "FPSCharacter.h"
				
		// Sets default values
		AFPSCharacter::AFPSCharacter()
		{
		 	// Set this character to call Tick() every frame.  You can turn this off to improve performance if you don't need it.
			PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = true;
		
		}
		
		// Called when the game starts or when spawned
		void AFPSCharacter::BeginPlay()
		{
			Super::BeginPlay();
			
			if (GEngine)
			{
				// Put up a debug message for five seconds. The -1 "Key" value (first argument) indicates that we will never need to update or refresh this message.
				GEngine->AddOnScreenDebugMessage(-1, 5.0f, FColor::Red, TEXT("We are using FPSCharacter."));
			}
		}
		
		// Called every frame
		void AFPSCharacter::Tick( float DeltaTime )
		{
			Super::Tick( DeltaTime );
		
		}
		
		// Called to bind functionality to input
		void AFPSCharacter::SetupPlayerInputComponent(class UInputComponent* PlayerInputComponent)
		{
			Super::SetupPlayerInputComponent(PlayerInputComponent);
		
			// Set up "movement" bindings.
			PlayerInputComponent->BindAxis("MoveForward", this, &AFPSCharacter::MoveForward);
			PlayerInputComponent->BindAxis("MoveRight", this, &AFPSCharacter::MoveRight);
		}
		
		void AFPSCharacter::MoveForward(float Value)
		{
			// Find out which way is "forward" and record that the player wants to move that way.
			FVector Direction = FRotationMatrix(Controller->GetControlRotation()).GetScaledAxis(EAxis::X);
			AddMovementInput(Direction, Value);
		}
		
		void AFPSCharacter::MoveRight(float Value)
		{
			// Find out which way is "right" and record that the player wants to move that way.
			FVector Direction = FRotationMatrix(Controller->GetControlRotation()).GetScaledAxis(EAxis::Y);
			AddMovementInput(Direction, Value);
		}

## Testing Character Movement

It's now time to compile and test your newly implemented character movement functions.

1.	Save the `FPSCharacter` header (\*.h) and CPP (\*.cpp) files in Visual Studio.

1.	Locate **FPSProject** in the **Solution Explorer**.

1.	Right-click on **FPSProject** and select **Build** to compile your project.

	![](BuildProject.png)

1.	After the build finishes, open your **FPSProject** in Unreal Editor.

1.	Click the **Play** button in the Level Editor Toolbar. By now, you should be able to move forward, backward, left, and right.

1.	Press the Escape key or click the **Stop** button in the Level Editor to exit Play in Editor (PIE) mode.
