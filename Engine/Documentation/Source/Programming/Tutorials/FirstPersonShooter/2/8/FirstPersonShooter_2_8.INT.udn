%Steps%

A common approach for building FPS games is to use two separate character meshes where one is the full-body mesh and the other is the "weapon and hands" mesh. 
The full-body mesh is used to see the character from a third-person perspective; however, it's hidden when the player is viewing the game in first-person perspective. 
The "weapon and hands" mesh is typically attached to the camera and is only visible to the player when they're viewing the map in first-person perspective.
During this step, we're going to add a first person mesh to our character.

## Adding the First Person Character Mesh

1.	Switch back to Visual Studio and open `FPSCharacter.h` to add the following code:

		// First-person mesh (arms), visible only to the owning player.
		UPROPERTY(VisibleDefaultsOnly, Category = Mesh)
		USkeletalMeshComponent* FPSMesh;

1.	Now, open `FPSCharacter.cpp`, go the constructor, and add the following code to create and configure the first person mesh:

		// Create a first person mesh component for the owning player.
		FPSMesh = CreateDefaultSubobject<USkeletalMeshComponent>(TEXT("FirstPersonMesh"));
		// Only the owning player sees this mesh.
		FPSMesh->SetOnlyOwnerSee(true);
		// Attach the FPS mesh to the FPS camera.
		FPSMesh->SetupAttachment(FPSCameraComponent);
		// Disable some environmental shadowing to preserve the illusion of having a single mesh.
		FPSMesh->bCastDynamicShadow = false;
		FPSMesh->CastShadow = false;

	`SetOnlyOwnerSee` indicates that this mesh is only visible to the `PlayerController` that has possessed this `Character`. 
	This code is also attaching the mesh to the camera and disabling some environmental shadowing.
	Allowing the the camera-attahed arms to cast shadows would destroy the illusion of having a single mesh for the first person character.

1.	Finally, add the following code to the constructor in `FPSCharacter.cpp` to hide the existing third-person mesh from the owning character:

		// The owning player doesn't see the regular (third-person) body mesh.
		GetMesh()->SetOwnerNoSee(true);

1.	Save the `FPSCharacter` header (\*.h) and implementation (\*.cpp) files in Visual Studio.

1.	Locate **FPSProject** in the **Solution Explorer**.

1.	Right-click on **FPSProject** and select **Build** to compile your project.

1.	After the build finishes, open and run your **FPSProject** in PIE mode.

	At this point, your character mesh should not be visible inside the editor.
	
## Building the Mesh Blueprint

[REGION:note]
Before continuing, download and extract our sample mesh from the following link:
["First Person Skeletal Mesh"](HeroFPP.zip "First Person Skeletal Mesh")
[/REGION]

1.	Right-click inside the Content Browser's file box to open the **Import Asset** dialog box

1.	Click **'Import to /Game...'** to open the **Import** dialog box.

	![](RightClickImport.png)

1.	Locate and select the **HeroFPP.fbx** mesh file.

1.	Click **Open** to begin importing the mesh to your project.

1.	In the **Content Browser**, the **FBX Import Options** dialog box appears. Clicking **Import** adds your mesh to the Project.

	[REGION:warning]
	Disregard the following error regarding smoothing groups:
	![](FBXWarning.png)  
	This mesh still illustrates the first person mesh set-up and it will work with the animations you'll set-up in a later section.
	[/REGION]

1.	Click the **Save** button to save your imported mesh.

1.	Navigate back to the **Blueprints** folder in the **Content Browser**.

1.	Double-click the **BP_FPSCharacter** icon to open it in the **Blueprint Editor**.

1.	Locate the new **FPSMesh** component in the **Components** tab.

	![](LocateFPSMeshComponent.png)

	The **FirstPersonMesh** component is a child of the **FirstPersonCameraComponent**, which means that it will always be attached to the camera.

1.	Click on the **FirstPersonMesh** in the **Components** menu.

1.	Scroll down to the **Mesh** section of the **Details** tab and click on the dropdown menu that says "None". 
	Now, select the **HeroFPP** skeletal mesh to add the arms to the **Viewport**.

	![](SelectHeroFPPSkeletalMesh.png)

1.	The newly added **HeroFPP** skeletal mesh should look like the following inside the **Viewport**.

	![](HeroFPPMesh_Viewport.png)

1.	Adjust the newly added mesh's transform to be in front of the camera by setting its **Location** to {240, 0, 35} and by setting its **Rotation** to {-180, 50, -180}.

	_Click on the image to zoom in._

1.	 Make sure to **Compile** and **Save** the **BP_FPSCharacter** Blueprint before closing the **Blueprint Editor**.

## Viewing the New Mesh In-Game

1.	Click the **Play** button in the **Level Editor Toolbar** to view the new mesh in-game.

1.	Press the Escape key or click the **Stop** button in the Level Editor to exit Play in Editor (PIE) mode.
