During this step, we'll give the character a skeletal mesh. The `Character` class creates a `SkeletalMeshComponent` object for us by default, so all it needs to know is which `SkeletalMesh` asset to use.

## Importing a Skeletal Mesh

1.	Navigate back to the Content folder inside of the Content Browser's file box.

1.	Now, right-click inside the Content Browser's file box to open the **Import Asset** dialog box

1.	Click **'Import to /Game...'** to open the **Import** dialog box.

1.	Locate and select the **GenericMale.fbx** mesh file.

1.	Click **Open** to begin importing the mesh to your project.

1.	In the **Content Browser**, the **FBX Import Options** dialog box appears. Clicking **Import** adds your mesh to the Project.

1.	Click the **Save** button to save your imported mesh.

## Setting up a Third Person Mesh

1.	Double-click the **BP_FPSCharacter** icon to open it in the **Blueprint Editor**.

1.	Click on the **Mesh** component in the **Components** tab.

1.	Align the `SkeletalMeshComponent` to the `CapsuleComponent` by setting its Z **Location** to "-88.0".

1.	The `SkeletalMeshComponent` should now resemble the following:

	[REGION:tip]
	It's good practice to locate your `SkeletalMeshComponent` within the `CapsuleComponent`, facing the same direction that the `ArrowComponent` is pointing, ensuring that your character moves correctly through the world.

1.	 Make sure to **Compile** and **Save** the **BP_FPSCharacter** Blueprint before closing the **Blueprint Editor**.

## Verifying the New Mesh in PIE Mode

It's now time to view your newly added mesh in-editor.

1.	Click the **Play** button in the Level Editor Toolbar. You should be able to see your character's shadow as you move around.

	[REGION:note]
	If you want to see your character's mesh inside the editor's viewport, press the F8 key to eject yourself from your pawn. After pressing the F8 key, you'll be able to to move your camera freely through the level. To move your camera, hold the left mouse button down while moving the mouse at the same time.
