During this step, we're going to create a starting point for our First Person Shooter (FPS) game by using Unreal Engine 4's Project Browser.

1.	After opening **Unreal Engine** from the Epic Launcher, a [](Engine/Basics/Projects/Browser) will appear.

1.	Click on the **New Project** tab and then select the **C++** tab.

1.	Now, select the **Basic Code** project.

1.	Name your project "FPSProject", making sure **No Starter Content** is set.

	Some of the code samples in this tutorial will need to be updated if you name your project differently.

1.	After you've named your project, go ahead and click the **Create Project** button.

1.	At this point, your project is open in the Unreal Editor. This is a good time to click the **Play** button to enter Play in Editor (PIE) mode.
