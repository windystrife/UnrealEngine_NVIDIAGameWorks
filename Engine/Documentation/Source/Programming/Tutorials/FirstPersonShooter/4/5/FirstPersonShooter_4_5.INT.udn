1.	Navigate to the **Blueprints** folder in the **Content Browser** and open the **BP_FPSCharacter** Blueprint.

1.	Select **FPSMesh** in the **Components** tab.

1.	Set the **AnimationBlueprint** for the **FPSMesh** to the **Arms_AnimBP** Animation Blueprint you just created.

1.	While you're in the **Defaults** mode, change the **FPSMesh** transform to {50, -15, -150} for **Location** and {0, 25, 350} for **Rotation**.
