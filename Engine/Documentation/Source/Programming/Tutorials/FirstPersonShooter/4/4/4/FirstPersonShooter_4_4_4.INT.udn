1.	Double-click the transition to edit it.

1.	Right-click in the graph, search for and select the **TimeRemaining for 'FPP_JumpStart'** node.

1.	Drag off the **Time Remaining** output pin and add a `<= (float)` node using the **Context Menu**.

1.	Enter 0.1 in the other output field on the `<= (float)` node and then wire the Boolean outputpin from that node to the **Can Enter Transition** input pin of the **Result** node.
