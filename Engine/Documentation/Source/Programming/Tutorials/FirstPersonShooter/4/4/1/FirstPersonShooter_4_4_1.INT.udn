During this step, we're going to set the idle to and from run transitions so that when your character starts moving, the state machine will transition from **Idle** to **Run**.

1.	Drag a wire from the **Idle** state to the **Run** state to create a transition.

1.	Double-click the transition to edit it.

1.	Control-click on **IsRunning** in the **My Blueprint** tab and drag into the graph to create a **Get Is Running** node.

1.	Connect the output pin from the **Get Is Running** node to the input pin of the **Can Enter Transition** pin on the **Result** node.
