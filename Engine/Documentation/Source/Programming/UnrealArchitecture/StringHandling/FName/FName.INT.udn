[EXCERPT:Overview]
When you name a new asset in the **Content Browser**, change a parameter in a Dynamic Material Instance, or access a bone in a Skeletal Mesh, you are using **FNames**. FNames provide a very lightweight system 
for using strings, where a given string is stored only once in a data table, even if it is reused.  FNames are case-insensitive. They are immutable, and cannot be manipulated. The storage system and static nature of FNames means 
that it is fast to look up and access FNames with keys.  Another feature of the FName subsystem is the use of a hash table to provide fast string to FName conversions. 
[/EXCERPT:Overview]

FNames are case-insensitive, and are stored as a combination of an index into a table of unique strings and an instance number. 

## Creating FNames

	FName TestHUDName = FName(TEXT("ThisIsMyTestFName"));


## Conversions

FNames can only be converted to FStrings and FText, and can only be converted from FStrings.

### From FName

|From | To | Example |
|---|------|---------|
%Programming/UnrealArchitecture/StringHandling:fnametofstring%
%Programming/UnrealArchitecture/StringHandling:fnametoftext%

### To FName

|From | To | Example |
|---|------|---------|
%Programming/UnrealArchitecture/StringHandling:fstringtofname%
%Programming/UnrealArchitecture/StringHandling:ftexttofname%
 
[REGION:note]
When doing these conversions, be aware that they may contain characters that are not valid for the type of FName you are creating.
The INVALID_NAME_CHARACTERS macro in NameTypes.h defines which characters are invalid for FNames, and several functions within
FName (such as **IsValidObjectName()**) check the validity of FNames for particular use cases.

## Comparisons

The == operator can be used to compare two FNames, and returns true or false.  Rather than doing string comparisons, this compares the values in Index, which is a significant CPU savings.

**FName::Compare** can also be used to compare two FNames, and it will return less than 0 if this less than Other, 0 if this equal to Other, and greater than 0 if this greater than Other.

	CompareFloat = TestFName.Compare(OtherFName); 

## Using FNames

Using an FName is pretty straightforward. Let us say that you wanted to get the bone named pelvis from the Skeletal Mesh Component of an Actor. The C++ code below shows the use of an FName constructed on 
the fly while being passed to **GetBoneRotation()**.

	FRotator rotPelvis = Mesh->MeshGetInstance(this))->GetBoneRotation(FName(TEXT("pelvis")));

This creates an FName that is passed to GetBoneRotation(), which returns the FRotator for that corresponding bone. The name of the bone gets loaded into the FName table when the package loads, 
so the constructor for the FName finds the bone's name in the hash table, avoiding an allocation.


## Searching the Name Table

If you want to determine if an FName is in the name table, but you do not want to automatically add it, you can supply a different search type to the FName constructor:

	if( FName(TEXT("pelvis"), FNAME_Find) != NAME_None )
	{
		// Do something
	}

If the name does not exist in the name table, the Index of the FName is set to NAME_None. Note that we are not checking a pointer for null as you would with a normal string.
