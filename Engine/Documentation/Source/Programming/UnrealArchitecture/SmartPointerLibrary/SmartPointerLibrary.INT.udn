## Smart Pointers

[EXCERPT:Overview]
The **Unreal Smart Pointer Library** is a custom implementation of shared references (**TSharedRef**), shared pointers (**TSharedPtr**), weak pointers (**TWeakPtr**) as well as related helper functions and classes.  This implementation is modeled after the C++0x standard library's shared_ptr as well as Boost smart pointers.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/SmartPointerLibrary/SharedPointer) (TSharedPtr) | Reference counted non-intrusive authoritative smart pointer. |
| [](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/SmartPointerLibrary/SharedReference) (TSharedRef) | Non-nullable, reference counted non-intrusive authoritative smart pointer. |
| [](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/SmartPointerLibrary/WeakPointer) (TWeakPtr) | Reference counted non-intrusive weak pointer reference. |

### Benefits of Shared References and Pointers

| Benefit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Clean syntax | You can copy, dereference, and compare shared pointers just like regular C++ pointers. |
| Prevents memory leaks | Resources are destroyed automatically when there are no more shared references. |
| Weak referencing | Weak pointers allow you to safely check when an object has been destroyed. |
| Thread safety | Includes thread safe version that can be safely accessed from multiple threads. |
| Ubiquitous | You can create shared pointers to virtually any type of object. |
| Runtime safety | Shared references are never null and can always be de-referenced. |
| No reference cycles | Use weak pointers to break reference cycles. |
| Confers intent | You can easily tell an object owner from an observer. |
| Performance | Shared pointers have minimal overhead.  All operations are constant-time. |
| Robust features | Supports const, forward declarations to incomplete types, type-casting, etc. |
| Memory | Only twice the size of a C++ pointer in 64-bit (plus a shared 16-byte reference controller.) |


### Reasons for Creating a Custom Library

* std::shared_ptr (and even tr1::shared_ptr) is not yet available on all platforms.
* Allows for a more consistent implementation on all compilers and platforms.
* Can work seamlessly with other Unreal containers and types.
* Better control over platform specifics, including threading and optimizations.
* We want thread-safety features to be optional (for performance).
* We have added our own improvements (**MakeShareable**, assign to NULL, etc.).
* Exceptions were not needed nor desired in our implementation.
* We wanted more control over performance (inlining, memory, use of virtuals, etc.).
* Potentially easier to debug (liberal code comments, etc.).
* Prefer not to introduce new third party dependencies when not needed.


### Helper Classes and Functions

Several helpers in the form of classes and functions are provided in the library to make using smart pointers easier and more intuitive.

| Helper | Description |
| --- | --- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Classes[/REGION]||
| TSharedFromThis | You can derive your own class from this to acquire a TSharedRef from "this." |
|[REGION:tablesection]Functions[/REGION]||
| MakeShareable() | Used to initialize shared pointers from C++ pointers (enables implicit conversion). |
| StaticCastSharedRef() | Static cast utility function, typically used to downcast to a derived type. |
| ConstCastSharedRef() | Converts a 'const' reference to 'mutable' smart reference. |
| DynamicCastSharedRef() | Dynamic cast utility function, typically used to downcast to a derived type. |
| StaticCastSharedPtr() | Static cast utility function, typically used to downcast to a derived type. |
| ConstCastSharedPtr() | Converts a 'const' smart pointer to 'mutable' smart pointer. |
| DynamicCastSharedPtr() | Dynamic cast utility function, typically used to downcast to a derived type. |

## Smart Pointer Implementation Details

The various types of smart pointers implemented in the Unreal Smart Pointer Library all share some general characteristics in terms of performance, memory, etc.

### Performance

Always keep performance in mind when considering using shared pointers. They are generally pretty fast; however, shared pointers are not meant to be used everywhere. They are great for certain high level systems, or tools programming, but not well-suited for low level engine/rendering paths.

 Some of the general performance benefits of shared pointers are:

* All operations are constant time.
* Shared pointer deference is just as fast as C++ pointer.
* Copying shared pointers never allocates memory.
* Thread-safe versions are lock-free.
* Fast implementation compared to Boost or STL.


Performance drawbacks of shared pointers include:

* Overhead to creating and copying pointers.
* Reference count housekeeping.
* Shared pointers use more memory than C++ pointers.
* Extra heap allocation for reference controller.
* One for each unique object referenced by any number of shared pointers.
* Weak pointer access is a bit slower than shared pointer access.


### Memory Usage

All shared pointers (TSharedPtr, TSharedRef, TWeakPtr) are 8 bytes (when compiling for 32-bit) consisting of:

* C++ pointer (uint32)
* Reference controller pointer (uint32)


[REGION:note]
TSharedFromThis is also 8 bytes as it embeds weak pointer.
[/REGION]

The Reference controller object is 12 bytes (when compiling for 32-bit) consisting of:

* C++ pointer (uint32)
* Shared reference count (uint32)
* Weak reference count (uint32)


[REGION:note]
Only one reference controller is created per object, no matter how many shared/weak pointers refer to an object.
[/REGION]

### Reflection

Shared pointers are non-intrusive which means the class itself does not know whether it is owned by a shared pointer (or reference). In general, this is okay, but sometimes you really want to access the current instance as a shared reference. The solution to this is to derive the class from `TSharedFromThis<>`.

By deriving from `TSharedFromThis<>`, you can use the **AsSharedRef()** method to convert 'this' to a shared reference. This can be very useful with class factories that always return shared references.

	class FAnimation : public TSharedFromThis<FMyClass>
	{
		void Register()
		{
			// Access a shared reference to 'this'
			TSharedRef<FMyClass> SharedThis = AsSharedRef();

			// Class a function that is expecting a shared reference
			AnimationSystem::RegisterAnimation( SharedThis );
		}
	}

### Casting

You can cast shared pointers (and references) easily. Up-casting is implicit, just like with C++ pointers.

Cast away const (evil, but sometimes necessary):

	ConstCastSharedPtr<T>( ... )

Static cast (often used to downcast to derived class pointers):

	StaticCastSharedPtr<T>( ... )

[REGION:note]
Dynamic cast is not supported (no RTTI.)  Instead, you should use the static cast above.
[/REGION]

### Thread Safety

Regular shared pointers are only safe to access on a single thread. If you need multiple threads to have access, use the thread-safe versions of pointer classes:

* `TThreadSafeSharedPtr<T>`
* `TThreadSafeSharedRef<T>`
* `TThreadSafeWeakPtr<T>`
* `TThreadSafeSharedFromThis<>`


These versions are a bit slower due to atomic reference counting, and behavior is mostly consistent with regular C++ pointers:

* Reads and copies are always thread-safe.
* Writes/resets must be synchronized to be safe.


[REGION:warning]
If you know your pointer will never be accessed by more than one thread, do not use the thread safe version.

## Usage Details

The SharedPointerTesting.h file (located in [UE4RootLocation]/Engine/Source/Runtime/Core/Public/Templates/) contains various examples of using shared pointers and references.

### Tips

* Usually you should "operator new" when passing a C++ pointer to a new shared pointer.
* Use TSharedRef or TSharedPtr when passing smart pointers as function parameters, not TWeakPtr.
* The "thread-safe" versions of smart pointers are a bit slower -- only use them when needed.
* You can forward declare shared pointers to incomplete types, just how you would expect to!
* Shared pointers of compatible types will be converted implicitly (e.g. upcasting).
* You can create a typedef to `TSharedRef< MyClass >` to make it easier to type.
* For best performance, minimize calls to TWeakPtr::Pin (or conversions to TSharedRef/TSharedPtr).
* Your class can return itself as a shared reference if you derive from TSharedFromThis.
* To downcast a pointer to a derived object class, use the **StaticCastSharedPtr()** function.
* const objects are fully supported with shared pointers!
* You can make a const shared pointer mutable using the **ConstCastSharedPtr()** function.
* Always convert to C++ references in deep stack frames. Shared pointers are best for member references, not stack temporaries.
* Unlike C++ pointers, shared pointers cannot be memcpy'd, so be sure to consider this when using arrays of shared pointers.


### Limitations

* Shared pointers are not compatible with Unreal objects (UObject classes)!
* Dynamically-allocated arrays are not supported yet (e.g. `MakeSharable( new int32[20] )`).
* Implicit conversion of TSharedPtr/TSharedRef to bool is not supported yet.


### Differences from Other Implementations

* Type names and method names are more consistent with Unreal's codebase.
* Thread-safety features are optional instead of forced.
* TSharedFromThis returns a shared reference, not a shared pointer.
* Some features were omitted (e.g. use_count(), unique(), etc.).
* No exceptions are allowed (all related features have been omitted).
* Our implementation supports non-nullable smart pointers (TSharedRef).
* Several other new features added, such as MakeShareable and NULL assignment.
