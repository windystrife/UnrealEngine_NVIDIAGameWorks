When programming gameplay elements using C++ code, each module can contain many C++ classes.

Each class defines a template for a new Actor or Object. Within the class header file, the class and any class [functions](Programming\UnrealArchitecture\Reference\Functions) and [properties](Programming\UnrealArchitecture\Reference\Properties)
are declared. Classes can also contain [structs](Programming\UnrealArchitecture\Reference\Structs), data structures that help with organization and manipulation of related properties. Structures can also be defined on their own.
[interface](Programming\UnrealArchitecture\Reference\Interfaces) allow additional gameplay behavior to be implemented by different classes. 

When programming with Unreal Engine, it is possible to have standard C++ classes, functions, and variables. These can be defined using standard C++ syntax. However, `UCLASS()`, `UFUNCTION()`, and
`UPROPERTY()` macros can be used to make Unreal Engine aware of the new classes, functions, and variables. For instance, a variable with a declaration prefaced by a `UPROPERTY()` macro can 
be garbage collected by the engine, and can be displayed and edited within Unreal Editor. There are also `UINTERFACE()` and `USTRUCT()` macros, and keywords for each macro that can be used
to specify the [class](Programming\UnrealArchitecture\Reference\Classes\Specifiers)'s, [function](Programming\UnrealArchitecture\Reference\Functions\Specifiers)'s, [property](Programming\UnrealArchitecture\Reference\Properties\Specifiers)'s,
 [interface](Programming\UnrealArchitecture\Reference\Interfaces\Specifiers)'s, or [struct](Programming\UnrealArchitecture\Reference\Structs\Specifiers)'s behavior within Unreal Engine and Unreal Editor.

 In addition to the above macros, there is a UPARAM() macro that is primarily used when exposing C++ code to Blueprints. To see examples of UPARAM() being used, see the [](Engine/Blueprints/TechnicalGuide/ExtendingBlueprints) documentation.
