[EXCERPT:Overview]
**Components** are a special type of **Object** designed to be used as sub-objects within **Actors**. These are generally used in situations where it is necessary to have easily swappable parts in 
order to change the behavior or functionality of some particular aspect of the owning Actor. For instance, a car is controlled and moves very differently from an aircraft, which is controlled and 
moves differently from a boat, etc.; yet all of these are vehicles that share other commonalities. By using a Component to handle the controls and movement, the same vehicle can easily be made to behave 
like any one of these specific types.
[/EXCERPT:Overview]

Contrary to the default behavior of sub-objects in general, Components created as sub-objects within an Actor are instanced, meaning each Actor instance of a particular class gets its own 
unique instances of the Components. A simple way to visualize this is to imagine the vehicle described above. A **Car** class might use Components to represent the wheels of the car. Four **Wheel** 
Components would be created as sub-objects in the default properties of the class and assigned to a `Wheels[]` array. When a new Car instance is created, new instances of the wheel Components 
are created specifically for that Car. If this were not the case, when one Car in the world moved, the wheels of all Cars would turn; which is clearly not the desired behavior. Instancing 
of Components by default simplifies the process of quickly adding unique sub-objects to Actors. 

[REGION:note]
Without Component instancing, all Component variables would need to be declared using the [Instanced](Programming\UnrealArchitecture\Reference\Properties\Specifiers\Instanced) property specifier.

## Actor Components

**ActorComponent** is the base class for components that define reusable behavior that can be added to different types of Actors. These are generally used to associate geometry with an Actor, 
in the form of collision geometry or rendered meshes, control how the Actor moves through the world, play sounds associated with the Actor, provide the ability for the Actor to cast light 
and shadows onto the world, and more. In fact, everything the player sees or interacts with in the world when playing the game is actually the work of one type of ActorComponent or another. 
ActorComponents that have a transform are known as **SceneComponents** and those that can be rendered are **PrimitiveComponents**.

### Registering Components

In order for ActorComponents to be updated each frame and affect the scene, they must **register** with the scene. Registration is performed by calling `UActorComponent::RegisterComponent()`. 

	void UActorComponent::RegisterComponent()

This function calls `UActorComponent::RegisterComponentWithScene()` to make sure that the ActorComponent is contained in the owning Actor's `Components[]` array, associate it with the 
scene, and create the [render proxy](#SceneProxy) and [physics state](#PhysicsState) for the ActorComponent. 

ActorComponents are automatically registered when the owning Actor is spawned, if they are created as sub-objects and added to the `Components[]` array in the default properties of the 
Actor. They can be registered at any time during play by calling `UActorComponent::RegisterComponent()`, but be aware that registering a Component is a somewhat heavy operation, so it should 
only be performed when necessary.

#### Register Events

When a Component is registered, the events below are fired off.

| Function | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| UActorComponent::OnRegister() | Event to allow for additional initialization when registering a Component, if necessary. |
| UActorComponent::CreateRenderState() | Initializes the render state for the Component. |
| UActorComponent::OnCreatePhysicsState() | Initializes the physics state for the Component. |


### UnRegistering Components

ActorComponents can be unregistered as well to avoid them being updated, simulated, or rendered. Unregistering a Component is performed by calling `UActorComponent::UnregisterComponent()`. 

	void UActorComponent::UnregisterComponent()

#### UnRegister Events

The events below are fired off when a Component is unregistered.

| Function | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| UActorComponent::OnUnRegister() | Event to allow for additional actions when unregistering a Component, if necessary. |
| UActorComponent::DestroyRenderState() | Uninitializes the render state for the Component. |
| UActorComponent::OnDestroyPhysicsState() | Uninitializes the physics state for the Component. |


### Updating

ActorComponents have the ability to be updated each frame via their `TickComponent()` function. This allows Components to perform type-specific, per-frame calculations. For example, 
**SkeletalMeshComponents** use `TickComponent()` to update animations and skeletal controllers, while **ParticleSystemComponents** use it to update the emitters of the system and check for particle 
events to handle.

In order for a Component to be updated, it must be registered, set to tick (`bComponentNeverTicks=false`), and have its tick function setup. 

### Render State

An ActorComponent must have a render state created in order to be rendered. The render state of an ActorComponent also lets the engine know whether something has changed about the Component 
that requires its render data to be updated. When such a change occurs, the render state is marked dirty. Then, at the end of the current frame, all dirty Components have their render data updated.

### Physics State

In order to be simulated using the physics engine, an ActorComponent must have a physics state created. Unlike the render state, the physics state is never marked dirty as physics updates happen 
immediately when changes occur. This is important as it keeps issues like frame-behind artifacts from happening.

## Scene Components

SceneComponents are an extension of ActorComponents that have a transform, i.e. location, rotation, and scale. The addition of a transform means SceneComponents can also be attached to one 
another.

### Attachment

In Unreal Engine 4, all attachment is handled on the Component level and only SceneComponents can be attached to one another. SceneComponents have an `AttachParent` property that points to 
the Component it is attached to. This is mainly used when an Actor contains multiple Components to keep them all attached, if this is the desired behavior. However, it can also be used to specify 
a Component belonging to another Actor to attach a Component in one Actor to a Component in another Actor.

This means that in order to attach one Actor to another, each of the Actors involved must contain at least one SceneComponent - as these are what will actually be attached - and the 
SceneComponent of the Actor that is being attached must be the root Component. The reason for this should be apparent; each Component can only have one parent so if the attached Component 
is not the root Component of the Actor being attached, that Component and any of its child Components are the only ones that will be attached. The root Component would remain unattached and 
unaffected, as would the Actor as a whole since it relies on the root Component and its transform.

### Component Transforms

The `FTransform` struct contains a `Translation` vector, a `Rotation` quaternion, and a `Scale3D` vector. Each SceneComponent has its own `FTransform`, generally for internal use, that 
describes its world-relative location, rotation, and scale. They also have an additional `RelativeLocation` vector, `RelativeRotation` rotator, and `RelativeScale3D` vector used which can act 
as either relative to their parent Component or relative to the world. These are generally what are used when getting or setting the transform for a Component.

By default, `RelativeLocation`, `RelativeRotation`, and `RelativeScale3D` are relative to their `AttachParent`. These values can be forced to be relative to the world using the `bAbsoluteLocation`, `bAbsoluteRotation`, and `bAbsoluteScale` properties. Setting any of these to `true` will cause the corresponding property to be world-relative.

Even when using parent-relative transform values, it is still possible to set translation and rotation using absolute world values via the methods shown below:


| Function | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| SceneComponent::SetWorldLocation() | Set the relative translation of this Component to put it at the supplied location in world space. |
| SceneComponent::SetWorldRotation() | Set the relative rotation of this Component to put it at the supplied orientation in world space. |

## Primitive Components

**PrimitiveComponents** are SceneComponents that contain or generate some sort of geometry, generally to be rendered or used as collision data. There are several subclasses for the various types 
of geometry, but the most common by far are the **CapsuleComponent**, **StaticMeshComponent**, and **SkeletalMeshComponent**. CapsuleComponents generate geometry that is used for collision detection, 
but not rendered; while StaticMeshComponents and SkeletalMeshComponents contain pre-built geometry that is rendered, but can also be used for collision detection.

### Scene Proxy

The `SceneProxy` of a PrimitiveComponent is an `FPrimitiveSceneProxy` instance that encapsulates the scene data that is mirrored in order to render the primitive in parallel to the game thread. 
A subclass of `FPrimitiveSceneProxy` is created for each primitive type to hold the specific render data necessary to render that type of primitive.

See [Rendering System Overview](Programming/Rendering) for more details on primitives and rendering geometry.
