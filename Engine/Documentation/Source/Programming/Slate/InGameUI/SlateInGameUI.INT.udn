Description:Using Slate UI widgets for in-game user interfaces.
Version:4.9


Slate widgets can be used in-game to create Heads Up Displays (HUDs) or other User Interface (UI) elements, such 
as menus. You will generally create one or more container widgets, each of which may be composed of several 
other types of widgets that are responsible for a particular aspect of the UI. 

<!-- HUD widget w/ menu overlay -->

For example, you may have a single overall widget for your game's HUD, as well as widgets for the main menu, 
options menu, pause menu, scoreboard, etc. Each of these widgets would then probably be made up of a combination of 
other custom widgets, labels, text boxes, images, and other types of elements.

<!-- container widget breakdown -->

Each of these container widgets can then be added or removed depending on the circumstances in the game: 

* When the game starts, a main menu widget would be added. 
* When they choose one of the options in the menu - to start the game perhaps - the main menu widget would then be removed. 
* If the player pauses the game at any point, the pause menu widget would be added.
* When the game is resumed, the pause menu widget is removed.
* When the HUD for the player is initialized, the HUD widget would be added.

## Displaying Widgets

In order to display a Slate widget in your game, it must be added to the game's viewport. Overlaid widgets 
are ordered according to the Z-order specified when adding them, with larger Z-order values appearing on top 
of smaller Z-orders.

### Accessing the Game Viewport

The game's viewport is an instance of the `GameViewportClient` class. A reference to the current game viewport 
is accessible via the `GameViewport` member of UEngine, which can be accessed using the `GEngine` global pointer 
to the current UEngine instance for the game. 

For example:

	GEngine->GameViewport

[REGION:note]
`GEngine` and `GameViewport` can be `NULL` so you should always check their values before trying to access them 
or any of their members.

### Adding the Widget to the Viewport

Slate widgets are added to the viewport by passing a reference - a `TSharedref<SWidget>` to be exact - to the widget 
to `GameViewportClient::AddViewportWidgetContent()`. This function takes in both a widget and a Z-order, which 
determines the sorting order for the new widget as mentioned previously. The Z-order is optional, however, and defaults 
to a value of `0`.

The reference to the widget you want to add to the viewport can be stored as a member of some class, such as your 
HUD, or it can be created and passed in at the time of calling the function. 

Passing a reference to a widget stored in a member variable (as a `TSharedPtr`):

	GEngine->GameViewport->AddViewportWidgetContent(
		SNew(MyWidgetPtr.ToSharedRef())
	);

Creating the widget using `SNew()` when passing it to `GameViewportClient::AddViewportWidgetContent()`:

	GEngine->GameViewport->AddViewportWidgetContent(
		SNew(SWeakWidget)
		.PossiblyNullContent(MyWidgetClass)
	); 

Or using `SAssignNew()` to create it, assign it to a `TSharedPtr` member, and pass it in:

	GEngine->GameViewport->AddViewportWidgetContent(
		SAssignNew(MyWidgetPtr, SWeakWidget)
		.PossiblyNullContent(MyWidgetClass)
	);

### Removing Widgets from the Viewport

Slate widgets can be removed from the viewport individually by passing a reference to a previously added widget 
to `GameViewportClient::RemoveViewportWidgetContent()`. 

For example:

	GEngine->GameViewport->RemoveViewportWidgetContent(
		SNew(MyWidgetPtr.ToSharedRef())
	);

In addition, all widgets can be removed from the viewport at once by calling `GameViewportClient::RemoveAllViewportWidgets()`

For example:

	GEngine->GameViewport->RemoveAllViewportWidgets();

[REGION:note]
`GEngine` and `GameViewport` can be `NULL` so you should always check their values before trying to access them 
or any of their members.
