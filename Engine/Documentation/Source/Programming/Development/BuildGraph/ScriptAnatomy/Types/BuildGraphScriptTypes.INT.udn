## Types

The following table contains valid data types that can be contained by BuildGraph attributes:

| **Target**              | A node name, aggregate name, agent name, or tag name. Indicates a sequence of nodes that need to be executed. Note that this overlaps with the meaning of `Target` as it applies to [UnrealBuildTool](Programming/UnrealBuildSystem) (which refers to a single program being built).       |
| **Target list**         | A list of target names separated by semi-colons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **File Spec**           | A set of file and tag names, separated by semi-colons. Wildcards such as `"..."`, `"*"`, and `"?"` are permitted when referencing files (i.e., `Engine/.../*.bat`). Unless otherwise specified, relative paths are resolved relative to the working root directory.                        |
| **File Name**           | A path to a file. Unless otherwise specified, relative paths are resolved to the working root directory.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| **Condition**           | A [conditional expression](Programming/Development/BuildGraph/ScriptAnatomy/Conditions).                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
