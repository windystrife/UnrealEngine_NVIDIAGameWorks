Title: Epic's Use of Markdown and Extensions to Syntax
Crumbs:DocumentationGuidelines
Description:How to create new documentation source files using Epic's custom Markdown extensions.

[TOC (start:2 end:3)]

[REGION:note]
**Note:** This document is itself written using Epic's Markdown; you can [see the source here](DocumentationGuidelines\SyntaxSource).
[/REGION]

##Overview

Epic's version of Markdown is based on [MarkdownSharp](http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/).  MarkdownSharp was based on [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) with some of the functionality from [PHP Markdown Extra](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/).

This document is intended to be a guide to the extensions made to support Epic's functionality and what specifically from Markdown Extra is being supported.  This syntax guide is supplemental to the original [Markdown Syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

## Epic's Functionality

### Auto generation of Table of Contents and Headings

The header generation is altered to include a bookmark which will be the heading with spaces removed.  To support multiple headers of same name, subsequent headers will be appended with an index starting at 2.
Generate a header list with correct indentation at the top of the document replacing the tag \[TOC\]

By specifying \[TOC (start:HeadingStartLevel end:HeadingEndLevel)\], you can set the heading levels which will be included in the table of contents. Start and end are optional variables. If missing, then start is given a value of 1, end is given a value of 6.  The end variable must follow start if both are set.

If the first characters of a header are !!, the header will not be included in the table of contents.

#### Markdown Syntax
	#Heading
	[TOC(start:2)]

#### HTML Output
	<h1 id="Heading1">Heading</h1>
	<ul><li><a href="#Heading">Heading</a></ul>


#### Results
The table of contents at the top of this page has been generated by the method outlined here \[TOC\] (start:2 end:3)

### Linking to bookmarks within document

Allow user to link to headers within the document, in addition to allowing the users to place bookmarks which can be linked to within the document

#### Markdown Syntax
	Here is an example link to a heading within the file [Auto generation of Table of Contents](#AutogenerationofTableofContentsandHeadings).  The header text is linked to by removing spaces in the text.  In addition if more than one header has the same name subsequent headers can be referenced by appending 2, 3 etc onto the name without spaces [Markdown Syntax 1](#MarkdownSyntax) [Markdown Syntax 2](#MarkdownSyntax2) [Markdown Syntax 3](#MarkdownSyntax3) 
	Here is an example link to a user defined bookmark within the document [Bookmark 1](#Bookmark1).
	(#Bookmark1) The bookmark text must be the first text on a line.

#### HTML Output
	<p>Here is an example link to a heading within the file <a href="#AutogenerationofTableofContents">Auto generation of Table of Contents</a>.  The header text is linked to by removing spaces in the text.  In addition if more than one header has the same name subsequent headers can be referenced by appending 2, 3 etc onto the name without spaces <a href="#MarkdownSyntax">Markdown Syntax 1</a> <a href="#MarkdownSyntax2">Markdown Syntax 2</a> <a href="#MarkdownSyntax3">Markdown Syntax 3</a> </p>
	<p>Here is an example link to a user defined bookmark within the document <a href="#Bookmark1">Bookmark 1</a>.</p>
	<p><a id="Bookmark1"/> The bookmark text must be the first text on a line.</p>
	
#### Results

Here is an example link to a heading within the file [Auto generation of Table of Contents](#AutogenerationofTableofContentsandHeadings).  The header text is linked to by removing spaces in the text.  In addition, if more than one header has the same name, subsequent headers can be referenced by appending 2, 3 etc onto the name without spaces. `[Markdown Syntax 1](#MarkdownSyntax)` `[Markdown Syntax 2](#MarkdownSyntax2)` `[Markdown Syntax 3](#MarkdownSyntax3)` 

Here is an example link to a user defined bookmark within the document [Bookmark 1](#Bookmark1).

(#Bookmark1) The bookmark text must be the first text on a line.

### Linking to other pages in our documentation

We link to other pages via relative links. If the document is in the root of the markdown folders, we use \%ROOT\% to reference it.  Languages are not specified in links, the assumption is that you will link to the file of the language you are currently viewing.

#### Markdown Syntax
	[UE4 Home](%ROOT%)
	[Unreal Editor User Guide](Engine/UI)

#### HTML Output
	<a href="./../../../INT\index.html">UE4 Home</a>
	<a href="./../../../INT\Editor\index.html">Unreal Editor User Guide</a>

#### Results
[UE4 Home](%ROOT%)

[Unreal Editor User Guide](Engine/UI)

### Linking to local images

We do not need to reference the image folder.  We only need to reference other paths if the image belongs to another page in the documentation, languages are not specified in the links, we try to locate the image in the language folders image directory first then default to the INT image folder.

#### Markdown Syntax
	![Logo](Logo_Epic-New.jpg)
	![Editor Viewport](Engine/UI/LevelEditor\Viewports\viewport.png) 

#### HTML Output
	<img alt="Logo" src="./../../../images\EpicMarkdownDocGuides\EpicMarkdownExtension\Logo_Epic-New.jpg"/>
	<img alt="Editor Viewport" src="./../../../images\Editor\viewport.png"/>

#### Results
![Logo](Logo_Epic-New.jpg)

![Editor Viewport](Engine/UI/LevelEditor\Viewports\viewport.png)

### Image Properties

It was desirable to have the ability to provide some formatting instructions for images and also how they would be converted.

	(w: h: a: convert: type: quality: fill: )

* 	**w:** The width to display the image at. If omitted, the width of the source image is used unless a height is specified, in which case the correct width corresponding to the height given the source image's aspect ratio will be used.
*	**h:** The height to display the image at. If omitted, the height of the source image is used unless a width is specified, in which case the correct height corresponding to the width given the source image's aspect ratio will be used.
*	**a:** Indicates the float style applied to the image with settings of left, right, and none. The default is none.
*   **convert:** A value of `false` or `true`, indicating whether an image should be compressed and/or converted to a different type. The default is true. This can be set to false to preserve quality or when the source format is important, such as in the case of an animated GIF.
*	**type:** The image format to convert to; can be one of `jpg`, `png`, `gif`. The default is `jpg`.
*	**quality:** The jpeg compression quality (`1`-`100`). The default for compression quality is `80`. Increasing this can help in cases where the default compression leads to artifacts that compromise the meaning of the image.
*	**fill:** A hex color ( using the format: `#0088FF`) indicating the background color of an image if the format being converted to is jpg. The default is `#FFFFFF`.

[REGION:note]
	* The order of options is important, but each is optional and can be omitted; or the entire bracket style after the image information can be omitted.
	* If the conversion parameters are missing, then the default values in the app.config file will be used.
	* Existing Markdown image inclusion methods Inline and Reference have both been extended to support the formatting.
	* Floating an image to the left or right can have an undesired result that unrelated content can surround the image. For example, when moving to a new section, we would not want the headers to be positioned to the side of an unrelated image.  This text is in a paragraph alongside the image.  The style sheet elements are used to control when to clear float styles by adding a "clear" [region](#Regions), and headings of levels 1, 2 and hr elements will stop floating.

### Tables
Tables are supported. The formatting available in the syntax for MultiMarkdown was very flexible and chosen to provide the basis for Epic.

*	Colons are used to indicate alignment of the tables data in a header row.
*	There can be pipes at the head and tail of lines, or they can be omitted.
*	Captions can be added.
*	Span columns are available.
*	Span rows are supported by using the ^ symbol in a cell.

### Metadata
This will be implemented similar to MultiMarkdowns syntax for metadata, with the following rules.

*	The metadata must begin at the very top of the document - no blank lines can precede it.
*	Metadata consists of the two parts - the key and the value.
*	The metadata key must begin at the beginning of the line. It must start with a letter or number, then the following characters can consist of letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, or underscore characters.
*	The end of the metadata key is specified with a colon.
*	After the colon comes the metadata value, which can consist of pretty much any characters (except new lines). 
*	After the metadata is finished, a blank line triggers the beginning of the rest of the document.


All metadata is placed in <meta name="Key" content="Value"/> html blocks in the header of the document.
Some key's in addition to the above have special functionality.

* Title metadata is used in the Header block `<title>Title</title>`
* HtmlDocumentType metadata is used to define which of the templates in the include/templates folder to use for html generation.  If missing, the default.html template file is used.
* DoIndex:false tells the indexer to exclude the document from the indexes, and thus search results.  The value true is default for all documents.
* ForcePublishFiles: can be used to force publish attachements and images to the html folders.


#### Markdown Syntax
	Keywords: Metadata is added at the top of the document with semi-colon's
	Title: This specifies the document title, however the path to the document will be used as a title if this metadata is missing.


#### HTML Output
	<title>This specifies the document title, however the path to the document will be used as a title if this metadata is missing.</title>
	<meta name="Keywords" content="Metadata is added at the top of the document with semi-colon's" />
	<meta name="Title" content="This specifies the document title, however the path to the document will be used as a title if this metadata is missing." />

#### Results
You can see the documents title bar has been updated with the title meta tag.
Viewing the document source will show the meta data in the documents head.

### Definition Lists

Syntax to support definition lists have been added to the conversion.  Definition lists operate with the same allignment and embeding rules as the markdown standard lists.

#### Markdown Syntax
	Defintion list elements at top level:
	$ Definition 1 : Description 1
	$ Definition 2 : Description 2
		* List element 1
			1. Ordered
			1. Ordered
		* List element 2
	$ Definition 3: Description 3


	Definition list elements embeded:
	* List element 1
		$ Definition 1 : Description 1
		$ Definition 2 : Description 2
	* List element 2

#### HTML Output

	<dl>
	<dt>Definition 1 </dt>
	<dd>Description 1</dd>
	<dt>Definition 2 </dt>
	<dd>Description 2

	<br/>
	<ul>
	<li>List element 1
	<br/>
	<ol>
	<li>Ordered</li>
	<li>Ordered</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li>List element 2</li>
	</ul></dd>
	<dt>Definition 3</dt>
	<dd>Description 3</dd>

	</dl>

	<ul>
	<li>List element 1
	<br/>
	<dl>
	<dt>Definition 1 </dt>
	<dd>Description 1</dd>
	<dt>Definition 2 </dt>
	<dd>Description 2</dd>

	</dl></li>
	<li>List element 2</li>
	</ul>

#### Results

Defintion list elements at top level:
$ Definition 1 : Description 1
$ Definition 2 : Description 2
	* List element 1
		1. Ordered
		1. Ordered
	* List element 2
$ Definition 3: Description 3


Definition list elements embeded:
* List element 1
	$ Definition 1 : Description 1
	$ Definition 2 : Description 2
* List element 2


### Additional Backslash Escapes

In addition to the characters that can be escaped by markdown, we also allow escaping:

    >   greater than
    |	pipe
    %	percent

## Markdown Extra Functions Used

### Strict Bold Italic

There must be spaces to the left and right of the opening and closing `_italics_` and `__bold__` syntax. This is to stop the false positive detection of these when used within File_names_including_underscores.

### Fenced Code Blocks

#### Markdown Syntax
`~~~`

Code fenced by 3 or more ~ characters

`~~~`

#### HTML Output
	<pre class="prettyprint"><code>Code fenced by 3 or more ~ characters
	</code></pre>
	
#### Results
~~~
Code fenced by 3 or more ~ characters
~~~

### Regions

Regions are are basically areas that can have a style applied, i.e. a div in HTML. You can specify a region using this syntax:

	[REGION:stylename]
	...
	[/REGION]

In HTML generation, this will be converted to:

	<div class="stylename">
	...
	</div>

You must also create a corresponding style rule in the css file:

	.stylename
	{
		background:#123456;
		border:1px solid #654321;
	}

#### Built-in Regions

Some styles for regions already exist for common things like notes, tips, warnings, and quotes.

	[REGION:note]
	This is a note. It is inside a yellow box and you can see the note icon at the top left.
	[/REGION]

[REGION:note]
This is a note. It is inside a yellow box and you can see the note icon at the top left.
[/REGION]

	[REGION:tip]
	This is a tip. It is inside a green box and you can see the tip icon at the top left.
	[/REGION]

[REGION:tip]
This is a tip. It is inside a green box and you can see the tip icon at the top left.
[/REGION]

	[REGION:warning]
	This is a warning. It is inside a red box and you can see the warning icon at the top left.
	[/REGION]

[REGION:warning]
This is a warning. It is inside a red box and you can see the warning icon at the top left.
[/REGION]

	[REGION:quote]
	This is quoted text. It is inside a blue box and you can see the quote icon at the top left.
	[/REGION]

[REGION:quote]
This is quoted text. It is inside a blue box and you can see the quote icon at the top left.
[/REGION]

### Objects

The Object system is a more flexible and versatile take on the Regions described above. In much the same way as a Region corresponds to a style in a stylesheet, an Object corresponds to an block of markup stored in a template. This allows any arbitrary markup to be inserted in into a document.

Objects are created using the `OBJECT` tag. The name of the Object is specified separated from the tag by a color (`:`). The most basic form of an Object is:

	[OBJECT:TemplateName][/OBJECT]

The matching template could contain any sort of HTML markup, javascript, etc. that would then replace any instances of the Object tag in any document.

#### Templates

Templates are HTML files stored in the `Include/Template/Objects` directory. The name of a template is important as this is how Objects are matched to templates. For example, an Object named `VideoPlayer` would be replaced by the markup found in the `VideoPlayer.html` template.

	[OBJECT:VideoPlayer][/OBJECT] <-> VideoPlayer.html

#### Parameters

To make Objects even more versatile, information and content can be passed to the template to be inserted into the markup before it is then inserted back into the document. This allows the same template to be flexible in its use. It is not just a straight replacement into the document; Objects are configurable in this manner.

There are two types of parameters available: normal and literal. Normal parameters are parsed as normal content within the page. This means they can contain markdown syntax and will be treated as markdown. Literal parameters will not be parsed at all. They are simply copied straight into the template exactly as they appear in the document.

To pass a parameter to a template, the `PARAM` and `PARAMLITERAL` tags are used within the Object. The name of the parameter is specified separated from the tag by a color (`:`). The simplest forms for parameters are:

	[PARAM:ParamName]ParamData[/PARAM]

and 

	[PARAMLITERAL:ParamName]ParamData[/PARAMLITERAL]

The data for each parameter is then used to replace parameter tags in the template that take the form:

	{ParamName}

An example with parameters using the VideoPlayer Object from before might be:

	[OBJECT:VideoPlayer]
		[PARAM:title]The **Awesome** Video[/PARAM]
		[PARAMLITERAL:video]AwesomeVideo.mp4[/PARAMLITERAL]
		[PARAM:related]
			* [Video 1](#Video1)
			* [Video 2](#Video2)
			* [Video 3](#Video3)
			* [Video 4](#Video4)
		[/PARAM]
	[/OBJECT]

The template for the VideoPlayer Object might then contain:

	<div class="videoplayer">
		<div class="title">{title}</div>
		<video>
			<source src="{video}" type="video/mp4">
		</video>
		<div class="related_links">
			{related}
		</div>
	</div>

In the HTML output for the page, the VideoPlayer Object would be replaced with:

	<div class="videoplayer">
		<div class="title">The <strong>Awesome</strong> Video</div>
		<video>
			<source src="AwesomeVideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		</video>
		<div class="related_links">
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#Video1">Video 1</a></li>
				<li><a href="#Video2">Video 2</a></li>
				<li><a href="#Video3">Video 3</a></li>
				<li><a href="#Video4">Video 4</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>

### Lightboxes

Images and other content be be displayed in a lightbox overlaid on the page by enclosing a link within a `lightbox` [region](#Regions).

### Image Lightboxing

For images, the link should point to the full size image to be overlaid on the page, while the _text_ of the link should display a smaller version, or thumbnail. The same image can be used for both, limiting the display image's size using [image properties](#ImageProperties).

Syntax:

	[REGION:lightbox]
		[![](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Editor.png)(w:480)](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Editor.png)
	[/REGION]

Result:

[REGION:lightbox]
	[![](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Editor.png)(w:480)](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Editor.png)
[/REGION]

### Including Files and Excerpts

The entire contents or a subsection from one page can be included into another.

The syntax for including an entire page is:

	[INCLUDE:Engine/Landscape]

This will cause the full Landscape page to be converted and inserted in the page containing that line.

Excerpts can be defined in a page using the following syntax:

	[EXCERPT:TerrainLayerCoords]
	...
	[/EXCERPT:TerrainLayerCoords]

This excerpt can be included using this syntax:

	[INCLUDE:Engine/Landscape/Materials#TerrainLayerCoords]

The result (shown in a quote region):

[REGION:quote]
[INCLUDE:Engine/Landscape/Materials#TerrainLayerCoords]
[/REGION]
