1.	Install [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/) then [fork and clone our repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/). 
	
	To use Git from the command line, see the [Setting up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) and [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) articles.

	If you'd prefer not to use Git, you can get the source with the 'Download ZIP' button on the right. The built-in Windows zip utility will mark the contents of zip files downloaded from the Internet as unsafe to execute, so right-click the zip file and select 'Properties...' and 'Unblock' before decompressing it. Third-party zip utilities don't normally do this.

1. 	Install **Visual Studio 2015**. 
   
	All desktop editions of Visual Studio 2015 can build UE4, including [Visual Studio Community 2015](http://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs), which is free for small teams and individual developers.
	Be sure to include C++ support as part of the install, which is disabled by default.
  
1.	Open your source folder in Explorer and run **Setup.bat**. 
	
	This will download binary content for the engine, as well as installing prerequisites and setting up Unreal file associations. 
	On Windows 8, a warning from SmartScreen may appear.  Click "More info", then "Run anyway" to continue.
   
	A clean download of the engine binaries is currently 3-4gb, which may take some time to complete.
	Subsequent checkouts only require incremental downloads and will be much quicker.
 
1.	Run **GenerateProjectFiles.bat** to create project files for the engine. It should take less than a minute to complete.  

1.	Load the project into Visual Studio by double-clicking on the **UE4.sln** file. Set your solution configuration to **Development Editor** and your solution platform to **Win64**, then right click on the **UE4** target and select **Build**. It may take anywhere between 10 and 40 minutes to finish compiling, depending on your system specs.

1.	After compiling finishes, you can load the editor from Visual Studio by setting your startup project to **UE4** and pressing **F5** to debug.
