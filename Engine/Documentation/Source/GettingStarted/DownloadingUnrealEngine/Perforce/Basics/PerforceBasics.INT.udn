## Connect to Epic's VPN

[EXCERPT:main]
Connecting to Epic perforce requires utilizing the SSL feature, and you must be running a 2012.1 or later version of a Perforce client (P4V, p4, or API). You can take advantage of latency based routing to automatically connect to the closest Perforce regional proxy by using the global DNS name. Alternatively, you can connect direct to a regional proxy to ensure you always connect to the closest one. 

## Connect to Epic's Perforce Server

1.	Install the P4V Perforce client for Windows. The client can be downloaded from the [Perforce Downloads](http://www.perforce.com/downloads/complete_list) page.

	[REGION:fullwidth]
	![Perforce Client](p4v.png)
	[/REGION]

1.	In the Open Connection dialog, enter the following connection info:

	* **Server**: _ssl:p4-licensee.epicgames.com:1667_
		
		[REGION:tip]
			The address above should automatically direct you to a regional proxy with the best latency based on your geographic location. If for some reason you need to connect to a specific regional proxy, you can connect to them using the addresses below:
			* **United States East (Virginia)**: _ssl:p4-licensee-east.us.epicgames.com:1667_
			* **United States West (Oregon)**: _ssl:p4-licensee-west.us.epicgames.com:1667_
			* **Asia Pacific Northeast (Tokyo)**: _ssl:p4-licensee-northeast.ap.epicgames.com:1667_
			* **Europe Central (Frankfurt)**: _ssl:p4-licensee-central.eu.epicgames.com:1667_
		[/REGION]

	* **User**: Perforce username provided by Epic Games.
	* **Password**: Perforce password provided by Epic Games.

1.	Press OK to connect to the Perforce Server.
	
1. In P4V, choose **Connection > New Workspace** to create a new workspace for the engine. Enter the information below and click **OK** to create the workspace:

	* **Workspace name**: _UE4_TeamName_ (This is a recommendation. You can choose any workspace name you like as long as it ends with your team name.)
	* **Stream**: Click **Browse** and select _//UE4/Release-Latest_ from the list of available streams.

1. In the Depot pane, click the **Filter Depot** button and select **Tree Restricted to Workspace View**.

[REGION:note]
Epic maintains a consistent certificate fingerprint for all broker and proxy SSL endpoints, however Perforce requires a trust per IP address + fingerprint pair. When connecting to an endpoint for the first time, you must explicitly trust that endpoint. The Epic fingerprint is 45:0D:78:E2:0E:9E:E4:82:45:80:16:36:29:5E:54:4D:66:31:6C:43.

P4V will prompt to trust the new endpoint:

![](fingerprint.png)(w:640 convert:false)

Command line p4 uses the p4 trust command. 

	$ p4 trust -y
	The fingerprint of the server of your P4PORT setting
	'ssl:p4-licensee-east.us.epicgames.com:1666' (52.23.106.194:1666) is not known.
	That fingerprint is 45:0D:78:E2:0E:9E:E4:82:45:80:16:36:29:5E:54:4D:66:31:6C:43
	Added trust for P4PORT 'ssl:p4-licensee-east.us.epicgames.com:1666' (52.23.106.194:1666)
[/REGION]

### Using a Local Proxy Server

If you are running a local proxy, you  must connect through a broker instead of using the region proxy servers. You can connect to the global broker using the address below:

* ssl:p4-licensee.epicgames.com:1666

[REGION:tip]
	The address above should automatically direct you to a regional broker with the best latency based on your geographic location. If for some reason you need to connect to a specific regional broker, you can connect to them using the addresses below:
			
	* **United States East (Virginia)**: _ssl:p4-licensee-east.us.epicgames.com:1666_
	* **Asia Pacific Northeast (Tokyo)**: _ssl:p4-licensee-northeast.ap.epicgames.com:1666_
	* **Europe Central (Frankfurt)**: _ssl:p4-licensee-central.eu.epicgames.com:1666_

## Download Unreal Engine 4

We distribute Unreal Engine 4 to licensees via the _//UE4/Release-Latest_ stream in the Perforce depot. This contains the entire 
engine along with several additional projects in the form of example games, samples, and demos. You have the option 
of downloading everything or picking and choosing only the parts you want or need. In order to get set up as quickly 
as possible, we recommend you only download the bare minimum to start with and then download other parts on an as-needed 
basis. This can dramatically reduce idle time spent waiting for the download to finish.

[REGION:warning]
	There are a large number of files in the _//UE4/Release-Latest_ stream and the total download size is many gigabytes so the 
	download can take quite a while when syncing the entire branch.
[/REGION]

1.	**Right-click** on the _UE4_ stream and choose **Get Latest Revision**.

	![Perforce - Get Latest Revision](get_latest_menu.png)

1.	The latest version of all files will be downloaded.

## Migrating an Existing Workspace

To avoid having to force sync your entire workspace when creating a new one on the global replica, users can use p4 flush to populate the have information based on the files in a local workspace. This procedure will be much faster than a force sync, and allow users to essentially pick up where they left off.

1. Create a new workspace on the global replica, copying the view and root settings from the original workspace.
1. Switch to the new workspace.
1. Issue p4 flush command or p4 sync -k to populate have information on the server. 
1. Old workspaces will be aged out automatically by Epic if they are unused for six months. 

[REGION:warning]
Users with write access rely on your P4 depot/VPN accounts to connect to Epic depots. These VPN accounts will remain active. Please do not transition to the cloud to avoid disruptions in service.
