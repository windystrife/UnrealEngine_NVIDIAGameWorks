**Components** are a special type of **Object** designed to be used as sub-objects within **Actors**. These are generally used in situations where it is necessary to have easily swappable parts in order to change the behavior or functionality of some particular aspect of the owning Actor. For instance, a car is controlled and moves very differently from an aircraft, which is controlled and moves differently from a boat, etc.; yet all of these are vehicles that share other commonalities. By using a Component to handle the controls and movement, the same vehicle can easily be made to behave like any one of these specific types.
