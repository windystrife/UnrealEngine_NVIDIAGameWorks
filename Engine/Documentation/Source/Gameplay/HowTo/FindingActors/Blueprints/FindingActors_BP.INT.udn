[TOC (start:2 end:2)]

This page covers examples on how to find Actors in a level by using the Get All Actors of Class node. This node when called will retrieve all Actors in your level of the specified Class and place them in an Array (collection of variables) and from that Array, you can pull out all Actors or individual Actors based on criteria you wish to filter by. You can then access the properties of the Actor(s) or modify them in some way based on the type of Actor it is and what you wish to achieve. 
 

## Get All Actors of Class
<!---
The steps below will show you how you can use the **Get All Actors of Class** node to find all Actors in your scene of a particular Class. 
--->

 _For this example, we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template with Starter Content**._

1.	Inside the **Content Browser** under **Game/Blueprints**, drag in three **Blueprint_Effect_Fire** assets. 

	![](Actors1.png)(w:800)

	Place them where ever you wish, we are simply adding these as the item to attempt to find. 

1.	In the **Content Browser** under the **Game/Blueprints** folder, open the **MyCharacter** asset. 

1.	In the graph of the **Blueprint Editor Window**, **Right-click** and add the **F** Key Event. 

	![](Actors2.png)

	When pressing **F**, we will attempt to locate the Actors in the scene. 

1.	Off the **Pressed** pin of the **F** Key Event, add the **Get All Actors Of Class** node. 

	![](Actors3.png)

	This will attempt to do as the name implies and get all the Actors of the specified class. 

1.	In the **Get All Actors of Class** node, click the **Actor Class** drop-down and add the **Blueprint_Effect_Fire** class. 

	![](Actors4.png)

1.	Drag off the **Out Actors** and add a **ForEachLoop** node. 

	![](Actors5.png)(w:800)

	The **Out Actors** is an **Array** of all the Actors (of the Class specified) and "For Each" of them we can do something.

1.	Drag off the **Array Element** of the **ForEachLoop** node and get **P_Fire** and **Fire Audio**. 

1.	**Right-click** in the graph and add a **Deactivate** node, then connect the fire and audio pins to the **Target**.

	Here we are saying when the player presses **F**, we will get all instances of the fire effect in the level and deactivate them. 

1.	Click the **Compile** button, then close the Blueprint and click **Play** to play in the Editor. 

You should be able to deactivate all instances of fire that you have placed in your level by pressing the **F** key. 

Using this method, we were able to find all Actors of a particular Class and affect them in some way, but what if you want to find all Actors of a particular Class and then find a set of Actors or a specific Actor within that Class and modify it instead of all of the Actors of that Class? The next section will show you some methods you can take to apply filters to your resulting Array and only get the one(s) you want from it instead of all of them. 


## Get Specific Actors

In the previous section, we learned that using the **Get All Actors of Class** node produces an Array of Actors of the specified Class. This section will show you how you can filter the Array results based on different criteria to get specific Actors or a single Actor from the Array. 

One method you can take is by using **Tags** on the Actor, for example: 

1.	Continuing from the example in the previous section, select one of the fire effects in your level. 

1.	In the **Details** panel, find the **Tags** section and click the plus sign to add a tag to the Actor. 

	![](Actors8.png)

1.	In the **0** field, enter some text such as **Target** for the tag. 

	![](Actors9.png)

1.	Inside the **MyCharacter** Blueprint, drag off the **Array Element** of the **ForEachLoop** and add the **Get Tags** node. 

	![](Actors10.png)

1.	Off the **Tags** pin, add a **Get** node. 

	![](Actors11.png)

	Here we are "Getting" the Tag at Index 0 (which we set as **Target** above). 

1.	**Right-click** in the graph and add a **Branch** node. 

1.	Drag off the **Condition** of the **Branch** and add an **Actor Has Tag** node. 

1.	Connect the out pin from the **Get** node to the **Tag** pin on the **Actor Has Tag** node. 

1.	Connect the **Array Element** of the **ForEachLoop** pin to the **Target** pin on the **Actor Has Tag** node. 

	![](Actors12.png)(w:800)

1.	Drag off the **Array Element** of the **ForEachLoop** pin to get **P_Fire** and **Fire Audio** and connect them to a **Deactivate** node.

	Here we are stating that after we have collected all Actors of the Class specified and put them in an Array, we then check each Actor to see if it has the Tag we specified and ONLY if it does, we deactivate it. 

Here is another example of filtering results:

In the example above, we are getting all Actors of the **Emitter** Class and not a specific Class of Blueprint (this could be used in the event that you have several emitters in your level such as smoke, fire, wind, rain, fog, etc. and you want to turn them all off). We are **Casting** to an **Emitter** Object then checking if the Emitter is Active and if so, deactivating it.  

You do not always need to **Cast** to an Object following the **ForEachLoop**, take the example below:

Here we are getting all Actors in our level of the Class **TriggerBox** and disabling collision on them (turning off all triggers in the level). We did not need to **Cast To** a TriggerBox as we are not accessing Components of the TriggerBox but the TriggerBox Actor itself. Whenever you want to access the Components that comprise the Actor, that is when you would want to use the **Cast To** node.
