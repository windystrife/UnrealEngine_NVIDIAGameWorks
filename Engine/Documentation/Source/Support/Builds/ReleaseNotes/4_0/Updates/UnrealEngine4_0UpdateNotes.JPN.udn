Notes:  When you get them, install Unreal Engine app from UnrealEngine_QFE_2039063.dmg to your /Applications folder, then open Terminal app and type: 

* open /Applications/Unreal\ Engine.app --args -noselfupdate

-noselfupdate argument is important because without it the app would update to official version that doesn't work for you. After you download the engine using Unreal Engine app, unzip QFE-FromCL-2034640-Shelve-2048959.zip and run the patch installer it contains. After that you should be able to use the editor etc. You can start the editor by launching it directly: /Users/Shared/UnrealEngine/4.0/Engine/Binaries/MacUE4Editor.app.
