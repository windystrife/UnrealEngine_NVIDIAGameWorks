Unreal Engine 4.6 arrives with a slew of lighting and material improvements, support for capturing and playing back network demos, and huge updates to animation workflows, including root motion blending and multi-montage support! The new Mobile Preview rendering mode lets you edit your scene just as it would appear on a mobile device. UI creation with Unreal Motion Graphics has been greatly enhanced, and you can now place interactive UI widgets right into 3D scenes. We’ve also continued improvements to mobile and console platforms in 4.6, along with hundreds of other features and bug fixes.

This release includes 88 great changes that were submitted from Unreal Engine’s amazing community of developers. We would like to extend our gratitude to the contributors below:

Navrotskiy (bozaro), Cengiz Terzibas (yaakuro), Flenzine, Gigantoad, Rama (EverNewJoy), Joel Riendeau (joelriendeau), Jakub Stasiak (jstasiak), Joe Hegarty (JoeHegarty), Marat Radchenko (slonopotamus), Michael Kösel (TheCodez), Michelle12188, Marcin Polaczyk (mpolaczyk), MyDigitalLife, mordentral, KazumasaOhashi, leobenaducci, Lukasz (iniside), Nicholas Hughes (piinecone), Sebastian Köcke (byte3), Salamanderrake, Stephen Whittle (stephenwhittle), Tomas Jedlicka (jedlickat), Rick Yorgason (Skrapion), Kyle Rocha (kylawl)

## Major New Features

#### Experimental: 3D Unreal Motion Graphics UI

UI widgets can now be attached to components and displayed in the 3D scene!

![](3DumgUI01.png)

* To use this feature, simply add a new “Widget Component” to your actor and assign a Widget asset to it.  This feature is still considered experimental but we’ll be improving it and adding more features soon.

* Your UI will be rendered to an offscreen target, then mapped to a 3D quad attached to your actor.  Input is supported too, so if your game displays a mouse cursor the user will be able to click on buttons and perform other interactions.

* You can configure rendering settings for your 3D widget in the Widget Component’s details view.  Don’t forget to set the “Draw Size” -- that controls the size of the render target the UI will be rendered to.

![](3DumgUI02.png)

#### Static Lighting from Emissive Materials
Emissive materials can now directly illuminate surrounding objects!

![](StaticLightingfromEmissiveMaterials.png)

* Turn this on using the new “**Use Emissive For Static Lighting**” option on shadow-casting components with Mobility set to “Static”.  When enabled, Lightmass generates baked direct lighting from emissive texture sources.  
* Note: this is a fast but limited version of emissive lighting.  Only direct lighting is computed but build time is not affected.  It is best used in scenes that have other light sources.

#### Static Lighting on Foliage
Precomputed lighting and shadows are now supported on foliage objects and instanced meshes!  This allows for very efficient rendering in scenes with Stationary or Static lights.

![](StaticLightingonFoliage.png)

Static lighting is appropriate for medium sized levels but does not scale up to huge scenes in build times or memory requirements.  Be sure to use very small lightmap resolutions on meshes that will be instanced many times.

#### Demo Recording (Network Replay Capture)
This allows you to save an “instant replay” of your gameplay!  It captures your game’s network stream to a “demo” file that you can play back later or share with others.  You can even use time-warping to slow down your game or fast-forward through it quickly.

![](DemoRecording.png)

Demo recording works automatically with any Unreal Engine game that is networking-enabled.

* To start recording, use the console command “DemoRec `<replay name>`”
* To play back a previously recorded game, use the console command “DemoPlay `<replay name>`”
* Try using the slow-motion and fast-forward features! Use the console command “Demo.TimeDilation `<multiplier>`”. For example, to play back at half speed use “Demo.TimeDilation 0.5”.
* The ShooterGame sample has been updated with built-in support for browsing saved replays using the new “Demos” in-game menu.  Check it out!  (Note that you still have to use “DemoRec” to save a replay, first.)

#### Experimental: Mobile Preview in Editor
You can now preview what your scene will look like on mobile devices directly in the editor viewport!  Shaders will emulate the look and feature set of OpenGL ES2, and you can switch back and forth seamlessly.

![](MobilePreviewInEditor.png)

* You have to enable Feature Level Preview under the Experimental section of Editor Preferences.
* On the main editor toolbar, click Settings -> Feature Level Preview -> ES2.

#### Experimental: Web Browser UI Widget
Host web pages right inside your game or editor tools using the new Web Browser UI widget.

![](WebBrowserUIwidget.png)

* The new Web Browser widget for Slate (SWebBrowser) can be used to easily navigate to interactive web pages and display them as part of your UI.  It’s powered by an embedded Chromium web framework (CEF3).  This feature is currently experimental and only supported on Windows platform.

#### Steam Online Sessions in Blueprints
Unreal now supports hosting, discovering and joining online sessions through Blueprint scripting!

![](SteamOnlineSessions.png)

* We’ve added new Blueprint nodes for hosting, joining, leaving, and finding online sessions, including both Steam and Local Area Network (LAN) sessions

* Here are the new nodes:
	* Create Session:  Hosts a session that can be discovered over the network.
	* Find Sessions:  Searches the network for sessions available to join.
	* Join Session:  Joins a session that was found with Find Sessions.
	* Destroy Session:  Leaves a session that was previously created or joined.

#### New Material System Features

###### Materials with Many Textures

* Materials can use up to 128 unique textures by making use of new 'shared' texture samplers.  These are set on a TextureSample node by setting the SamplerSource property.  Previously, you could only use up to 13 textures.

![](MaterialsWithManyTextures.png)

* This is a really important improvement for layered materials like terrain, high quality character materials, and more advanced forward shading materials.

* DirectX 11 and consoles support 128 textures at once, but the OpenGL rendering path (on Windows or Mac) is still limited to 13 textures per material.  Shaders will fail to compile for GL if they exceed this limit.

###### Real-time Preview of Scalar and Vector Parameter default values

* You can now change the default value of any scalar or vector parameter and see the result instantly in all 3D viewports.

* This is especially useful for Material Functions that implement layers, as you can see the results of a tweak to the layer on all the materials in the scene that use that function.  You can also right click to quickly convert constants to parameters for easy tweaking, then convert them back when you’re done.

###### Expose Parameters from Material Functions

* Material Instance parameters are now supported in functions.  This makes it really easy to expose parameters to material instances. This brings functions to feature parity with materials, the same node graphs can be used in either.  The only exceptions are the function input and output nodes which are inherently function-only.

* Note that parameters within a material are set by name, so if you have two parameters named 'wetness' in different functions referenced by that material, they will both be overridden with the same value in the Material Instance.  This can be used intentionally but if you don't want to share the parameter, give it a unique name.


#### Animation: Play Multiple Montages

Until now you could only play one Montage at a time on a Skeletal Mesh. Now you can play as many as you would like!

Here’s how it works:
* Animations are now organized into groups. You can play a single montage per group. Want to be able to play another montage at the same time? Simply create a new group for it.
* We’ve centralized Slots and Groups creation into a new ‘Anim Slot Manager’ tab inside of Persona (see below).
* There’s a new drop-down UI to select valid slots.  You know longer have to type in animation slot names by hand.  
* When playing a  Networked Root Motion Montage, you are still limited to just one montage at a time.
* New Montage assets and Slot nodes start out with a single 'Default Slot' so they’re immediately functional

**Anim Slot Manager**

* The ‘Anim Slot Manager’ is where you will manage your Slot and Group names. It displays hierarchical view, and lets you make changes.

![](AnimSlotManager01.png)

* Groups and Slots are saved in the Skeleton asset, so all AnimBlueprints and AnimMontages from the same family use the same settings.
* A convenient ‘Save’ button was added to manager, so you don’t have to be surprised when the editor asks you to save the Skeleton asset when you make a change.
* When clicking on a Slot name, the context menu will also allow you to move it to a different group:

![](AnimSlotManager02.png)


**Editing Slots on Montage Tracks**

Here is the view of the Montage Editor.  Note the Combo Box at the right of the track. This will list all of the available Slots for that track.

![](EditingSlotsonMontageTracks01.png)

​If you need to create new a new Slot or a new Group name, the Magnifying Glass will take you to the Anim Slot Manager:

![](EditingSlotsonMontageTracks02.png)

The Status Bar on top will tell you which Group the Montage belongs to.  This is determined by the first Track’s Slot.

![](EditingSlotsonMontageTracks03.png)

If you have multiple Slots, the Status Bar will also tell you if there are any issues with the setup.  For example, if you mix and match Slots that belong to different groups, the little warning sign appears, and you can hover over it to see more about the problem.

![](EditingSlotsonMontageTracks04.png)

**Editing Slots in Animation Blueprints**

* In the AnimGraph, a “Slot” node will display its Slot and Group names:

![](EditingSlotsinAnimationBlueprints01.png)
​
* With the node selected, over in the Details panel you can see the same options as in the Montage Track view:

![](EditingSlotsinAnimationBlueprints02.png)

* From here. you can use the combo box to pick an existing Slot name and the Magnifying Glass to open the Anim Slot Manager.
* Additional notes:
	* This is backwards compatible with previous setups.  You shouldn’t notice any changes other than your existing Slots being part of a ‘Default Group’.
	* The ‘Anim Slot Manager’ does not let you rename or delete Slot/Groups yet, this will be added at a later date.
	* The Montage Blueprint and C++ API has been enhanced to take Montage asset references. This is how you can control different montages playing at the same time.  For an example, check out the updated “Set Play Rate” function.


#### Root Motion from Everything

Unreal Engine now supports blended root motion from multiple animations!

* We’ve added different modes for handling root motion with Animation Blueprints. The mode can be set via the "**Root Motion Mode**" drop down on the Anim Blueprint Editor. Code can also modify this setting at run-time if dynamic behaviour is required.

![](RootMotion01.png)

* The options are as follows:
	* **No Root Motion Extraction** - Root motion is left as is (applied to the root bone).
	* **Ignore Root Motion** - Root motion is extracted (and removed from the root bone), but not applied to the character.
	* **Root Motion from Everything** - New method of handling root motion (explained below).
	* **Root Motion from Montages Only** - This is the original root motion behaviour (and the default for all new blueprints).

Setting up root motion on assets:

![](RootMotion02.png)

* There is a new “Enable Root Motion” setting in your Anim Sequence. This replaces the older "Enable Root Motion Translation" and "Enable Root Motion Rotation" options that used to be in the AnimMontage (they will automatically be updated when loaded.)

* **NOTE**: The original settings on AnimMontage still exist and have not yet been flagged as deprecated. This is intentional as it helps us correctly propagate them to their animation sequences. They are no longer editable from Persona and no one should be writing code that reads/writes to them.

**Root Motion from Everything**:

* Each animation asset (sequence, blendspace, montage etc) that contributes to the final character pose has its root motion extracted (if it has been set as containing root motion). Each piece of extracted root motion is blended based on the weight of the source assets contribution to the pose.


![](RootMotion03.png)

* For example: In the above graph the root motion of **Jog_Loop_Fwd_RM** and **Jog_Loop_Right_RM** would each be blended together with a weight of 0.5. The resulting animation in this case is a character running diagonally forwards and right across a map.

* Note: The original system (now labelled "Root Motion from Montages Only") was designed with network games in mind, which is the reason for its more restricted functionality. Because "Root Motion from Everything" is designed to be complete unrestricted, we recommend using it only in games where animation isn’t replicated over the network.


#### Animation: “Humanoid Rig” Quick Select

* A new feature in Persona has been added to select the **Humanoid Rig** that is built into the engine. This rig is commonly used for animations you’ll find on the Unreal Engine Marketplace.   

![](HumanoidRigQuickSelect.png)

#### New Blueprint Editor Menus
We’ve redesigned how Blueprint editor’s right-click menu works to provide more accurate and relevant results.

![](BlueprintEditorMenus01.png)

* As usual, drag off from a node to show a context menu with nodes that pertain directly to that type of node. You can configure this feature using new options Blueprint editor’s preferences:

![](BlueprintEditorMenus02.png)

#### Larger 3D Worlds
The maximum size of an individual world has been increased to approximately **20 kilometers** across. Also, we now support 3D world origin shifting (instead of only 2D shifting.)

* This is defined by the ‘WORLD_MAX’ constant in C++ code.  It was increased by a factor of four (from approximately 5 km.)

* Remember, you can create worlds as large as you want by connecting multiple worlds together using Unreal Engine’s World Composition feature!

#### Faster Packaging and Cooking
Packaging or cooking content from within the editor is now faster than ever!

* When cooking from within the editor, we no longer need to invoke a new process.  This means that assets loaded in the editor can be cooked directly from memory which speeds up processing significantly.

* This is enabled by default, but you can switch back to using the old system using the “Disable Cook in Editor” preference if needed.

#### Navigation Mesh Streaming
Unreal Engine can now stream sections of precomputed navigation data in or out of memory on the fly.

* You can save static navigation mesh data into different sub-levels and the engine will stream this data with that level

* By default, any part of your navigation mesh that intersects with a navigation volume will be saved into the same sub-level where that volume was placed


#### Unreal C++ Programming

**Simplified Class Declarations**
* You now define and use "normal" C++ constructors for your classes.  You can use parameterless constructors too now!
* You no longer need to supply a category for your properties to expose them to the editor or Blueprints.  You'll get a default category now.
* FPostContructInitializeProperties is deprecated.  It's replaced by FObjectInitializer, and you only have to specify it when you actually need it
* "GENERATED_BODY" no longer resets your protection level to "public".  It will preserve your settings.
* Please use the new "GENERATED_BODY" specifier instead of "GENERATED_UCLASS_BODY".  It enables many of these new improvements!

**Simplified Casting**
* Easily cast between Unreal classes using the improved Cast() function.  You can even cast between interfaces and classes.  We also now support using dynamic_cast to cast between Unreal types, if you prefer that.

**Other C++ Improvements**
* New support for C++ 11 lambdas with delegates (see below), as well as the new TFunction class (lightweight lambda wrapper)
* We're getting rid of TSubobjectPtr.  It was confusing and weird.  Just use normal pointers to your sub-objects now!
* We no longer need to synthesize "dummy" UObjects if you only have structs and enums in your source file

#### UI: Game Controller Support
You can now navigate between UI elements using a joystick!

* By default you can use the arrow keys, directional pad or left joystick to navigate.  You can still use Tab or Shift+Tab as well.  This works with both Slate and Unreal Motion Graphics.

* We’ve unified the concept of “Keyboard Focus” and “Controller Focus” into “User Focus”. Changing user focus will affect all controllers and keyboards for that user.


#### UI: Composite Fonts
Slate and UMG now support font families and composite fonts.  These allow you to create fonts that are actually made up of multiple sub-fonts, and each font can be used for different ranges of characters.  This is really useful for displaying localized text.

**Font Assets**
* The font asset type has been updated to support embedding a composite font along with its associated TTF or OTF font file data.
* Font assets now support two caching methods; "Runtime" which is the new composite font way, or "Offline" which is the older pre-computed font atlas way. You can easily switch between the two in the font editor, providing a simple way to convert existing font assets without having to replace them.
* Creating a new font asset will now default to creating an empty composite font, and you're also able to create a composite font asset by importing a TTF or OTF file into the Content Browser.

**Font Editor**
* The font editor has been updated to allow you to create composite font assets.

![](FontEditor.png)

* A composite font will always contain a default font family, and may also contain any number of sub-font families that should be used for a given range of characters. Each font family is itself made up of any number of fonts that can be named based on their style.
* At runtime we pick the most suitable font to use for each character based on the fonts available in the font family for that character range.
* As you can see in the preview above, the Japanese text falls within the character ranges of the Japanese font family, and so is drawn using Source Han Sans rather than Roboto. Fonts in a sub-font family are preferably chosen by name match, as in the case of Regular, Bold, and Light, however can also fallback to matching based on the attributes of the default font, as is the case of Bold Italic (it automatically chose the Bold Japanese font because the font contained the Bold attribute, and was the best match).

**Fonts in Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG)**
* The old interface in UMG that let you specify a TTF or OTF file from disk has been removed, and replaced with an asset picker that lets you choose a composite font asset, and then pick a font from the default font family.

![](FontsInUMG01.png)
![](FontsInUMG02.png)

* None of your existing file based font settings will be lost, however going forwards you must use font assets with UMG.
* UMG currently only supports "Runtime" cached font assets.

**Fonts in Slate**
* Any existing font code in C++ based Slate style sets will still work, however you might want to consider updating your style sets to take advantage of composite fonts.
* We recommend using FStandaloneCompositeFont rather than font assets when dealing with composite fonts in C++ Slate code.
* This is because font objects contained within Slate style sets are not visible to the garbage collector. Using a font asset directly would require an external reference to be maintained yourself, using something like FGCObject.

**Fonts in Canvas**
* Canvas supports both types of font asset caching, however this is to improve the localization support for some of our tools.
* We do not recommend using Canvas for new game UIs, and would suggest using UMG instead.

* New: Can now create blueprints from vert-painted meshes in the world (painted vertex data is copied over).
* New: Reinstance Only When Necessary:
	* Added mechanism to distinguish if instances of recompiled BPGC must be reinstanced or not during recompilation (e.g. adding a new function or variable)
	* When not needed, we skip reinstancing after compilation, which cuts out significant time from the compilation process
* New: For the new blueprint menu system, user can now specify a node's category/name/tooltip directly in GetMenuActions().
* New: New Blueprint editor preference setting that can be used to toggle on/off the "Target" of the Blueprint context menu.
* New: Can now toggle cast nodes to have execution pins or not (allows casts to be used in anim graphs). NOTE: the cast could still fail and return an invalid object.
* New: Users can now hook into the Blueprint editor and provide their own hot-key commands (through FBlueprintEditorModule::GetsSharedBlueprintEditorCommands).
* Reduced the wastage on the graph clipping guard band from half the size of the graph each edge to quarter. This is intended to make the clipping more aggressive ideally with no visual difference to make it more performant.
* Minor fix to prevent the documentation tooltip from moving when you try to click on a link in composite nodes.
* Fix for issue with namelist values not syncing first value to the pin. If the initial value does not match the pin value, the pin value gets synchronized to the value displayed in the UI.
* Curve graph min and max are now preserved during blueprint changing/saving.
* Math Expression graphs are now read only.
* Fixed crash when compiling Animation Blueprint while animation Property Matrix was open.
* Pins can no longer be added/removed from boolean select nodes.

	* This allows players to dodge towards vertical walls more effectively, and also steer laterally down unwalkable slopes rather than taking away all air control in these cases.
	* HandleSlopeBoosting() now prevents upward boosts no matter the incoming velocity. We used to only limit it if moving upwards, but you can deflect upwards when moving horizontally or downward, which bypassed that check.

	* Added 'bIsSliding' to indicate if the projectile is sliding/rolling, and fixed behavior with multiple impacts between frames. Fixes friction behaving inconsistently depending on the framerate.
* New: Fixes to projectile movement uses of friction, and improvements to behavior when sliding along a surface, to remove variance under different timesteps and to apply consistent friction.
	* Sliding movement now considers the acceleration (in any direction, not just gravity) and handles it in a new function: HandleSliding().
	* Friction is applied correctly when movement is parallel to and impacting a surface ("sliding").
* New: Add enum controlling MovementComponent plane constraint / axis-locking behavior. Modes are: custom, X, Y, Z, and an option to use the global physics axis setting.
	* The option to use the global physics setting makes it easier to keep multiple blueprints using the same plane constraints.
* New: Fixed FVector::Parallel() and added FVector::Orthogonal().
	* Add FVector::Orthogonal() for determining if two normals are orthogonal / perpendicular within a tolerance.
	* FVector::Coplanar() now takes a threshold for controlling the parallel test.
	* Add THRESH_NORMALS_ARE_ORTHOGONAL for orthogonality test.
	* Rename THRESH_VECTORS_ARE_PARALLEL to THRESH_NORMALS_ARE_PARALLEL, and change the meaning to the cosine of the angle we compare to.
	* Fix FVector::Parallel() reporting false for parallel vectors pointing in opposite directions. Use FVector::Coincident() if you care about the direction.

* Blueprint added components that have native defined subcomponents are now properly registered during reconstruction.
* World teardown now occurs in GameEngine::PreExit instead of HandleExitCommand.
	* SlateApplication shutdown now occurs after Engine and App PreExit
* Don't display events that are not valid for Emitters in blueprint context menus.
* Fixed calculation in DrawDebugCylinder flagged on UDN which was doing float math with integers which resulted in incorrect behavior.
* Don't call SetIsReplicated in constructor, just set bIsReplicates directly
* SSpinBox no longer teleports the cursor to a random position on the screen.

* Fixed memory leak in FPhysicsScene2D
* Removed incorrect bWillEverBeLit=false in 2D sprite render scene proxies
* Fixed path following in CharacterMovementComponent, so that it turns more quickly and considers current velocity when trying to reach destination speed.
	* Restored "bRequestedMoveUseAcceleration" which can be set to false to disable acceleration and use requested pathfinding velocity directly (instant turning).
* APlayerController::PostProcessInput() uses IsLookInputIgnored() virtual rather than reading IgnoreLookInput variable directly.
* Fixes to projectile movement uses of friction, and improvements to behavior when sliding along a surface, to remove variance under different timesteps and to apply consistent friction.
	* Sliding movement now considers the acceleration (in any direction, not just gravity) and handles it in a new function: HandleSliding().
	* Friction is applied correctly when movement is parallel to and impacting a surface ("sliding").
* MovementComponent auto registration of tick function moved to OnRegister() rather than InitializeComponent().
* ProjectileMovementComponent velocity initialization moved to OnRegister() from InitializeComponent().
* Avoid updating the PhysicsVolume in MovementComponent::SetUpdatedComponent() if executing during registration, it will occur as part of UpdateOverlaps() in registration anyway.
* CharacterMovementComponent::SetUpdatedComponent() makes sure the OnComponentBeginOverlap delegate is added uniquely.
* Fixed AHUD::GetCoordinateOffset() returning uninitialized FVector2D when there is no local player.
* CharacterMovement StepUp() function aborts if forward movement results in no net change in position.
	* Step downs are also limited to step up height when not walking.

	* Also reduces the worst-case number of sweeps in character movement (previously occurred when pushing into corners).
* Removed redundant GetWorld() call in SceneComponent::GetPhysicsVolume()
* Fixed MovementComponent::ComputeSlideVector() calculating incorrect deflection vector when the plane constraint is enabled.
	* Rather than projecting the final result onto the movement plane, the normal should first be projected onto the plane and normalized.
	* This fixes cases where collision with geometry angled outside the movement plane would stop movement, rather than deflect it.
* Don't recalculate Character velocity when falling if there was a teleport (usually adjustment out of penetration).
* Improve Pawn physics penetration handling when overlapping more than one object/surface.
* Use a combined MTD result to get an adjustment that moves out of both objects.
* MovementComponent::TwoWallAdjust() uses ComputeSlideVector() rather than an explicit vector projection.
	* Extra call to HandleSlopeBoosting() removed in CharacterMovementComponent::PhysFalling() since it's handled by TwoWallAdjust()'s call to ComputeSlideVector() now.
* Tweak to air control limit code, to allow pushing in to vertical surfaces so you still get the hit event. Angle surfaces that normally restrict air control still get the event due to contacts caused by gravity.
* Fix SceneComponent::MoveComponent() so it always fills in the out HitResult no matter the control path.
* FHitResult default constructor initializes 'Time' variable to 1.0.
* Added 'bBlockingHit' boolean to BreakHitResult.
* New: Add hit result to all Actor and SceneComponent transform functions, for both C++ and Blueprints.
	* Blueprints now have a way to get the hit result of swept movement to be able to implement more complex movement without the need for C++ code.
* CharacterMovement Falling doesn't need to check air control before the first move, since deflection uses the non-air control velocity to deflect.
* Fixed crash in CharacterMovementComponent if setting UpdatedComponent to NULL.
* MovementComponent::SetUpdatedComponent avoids changing physics volume and trying to unbind delegate (causing ensure) if object is pending kill.
* Fix UpdateOverlaps() call in DetachFromParent() causing incorrect notification when called from AttachTo() and the object does not maintain world position.

## Upgrade Notes

#### C++ API Changes

* UMaterialExpressionTextureSample and UMaterialExpressionTextureSampleParameter's ConstMipValue value, and UMaterialExpressionIf's ConstAEqualsB value were previously used verbatim. Now they are processed by the compiler, so check these values first if you notice any oddities in a material.
* After switching to using the new “GENERATED_BODY” macro there can be redefinition compiler errors. To fix that you have to either:
	* Declare the FObjectInitializer constructor in header file, or
	* Delete definition of FObjectInitializer constructor from source file (if it does nothing more than default constructor).
	* You may need also to change protection level as GENERATED_BODY() macro will preserve spotted protection level, while old macro was always setting to public.
* You may have to rename the class in your code to avoid deprecation warnings.
* All SCOPED_*_DRAW_EVENT* functions now omit the event color
* Changes to the API of GetBoneLocation and GetBoneQuaternion
* All Montage API now takes an optional Montage pointer to control different Montage assets at the same time.
* ULevelBase has been eliminated, however, all things should have been inheriting/referencing ULevel anyways.
* Existing usages of AReverbVolume in C++ will need to be changed to AAudioVolume
* Changed GetBoneLocation, GetBoneQuaternion to use bone space enum instead of ints
* AnimMontage's bEnableRootMotionTranslation and bEnableRootMotionRotation have been combined and moved to bEnableRootMotion on AnimSequence's. The values still exist on AnimMontages but should not be used.
	* UAnimMontage::Advance now takes a flag to specify whether root motion should be blended or not
	* UAnimSequence::ResetRootBoneForRootMotion now takes the value for ERootMotionRootLock::Type RootMotionRootLock directly instead of the owning FAnimExtractContext
* Any API which refers to a delegate will now have a different decorated linker symbol.
	* Any code which referred to internal delegate implementation types, e.g. TBaseDelegate_NoParams, will no longer compile and should be replaced with the equivalent DECLARE_* macro.
* RemoveFromViewport is now deprecated, use RemoveFromParent.
* InterfaceCast has been deprecated - Cast or dynamic_cast should be used instead.
* CopyConstructItems and RelocateItems have been deprecated.
	* Their use should be replaced with ConstructItems and RelocateConstructItems, which support construction/relocation between different types.
* FAnimNotifyEvent StartTime deprecated - Replaced with methods GetTime() and SetTime()
	* FBranchingPoint DisplayTime deprecated - Replaced with methods GetTime() and SetTime()
	* FCompositeSection DisplayTime deprecated - Replaced with methods GetTime() and SetTime()
* API changes (must be changed):
	* FViewport::CaptureJoystickInput(bool Capture) renamed to FViewport::SetUserFocus(bool bFocus)
		* EKeyboardFocusCause renamed to EFocusCause
		* FKeyboardFocusEvent renamed to FFocusEvent
		* FKeyboardEvent renamed to FKeyEvent
		* SWidget::OnKeyboardFocusReceived(...) use SWidget::OnFocusReceived(...)
		* SWidget::OnKeyboardFocusLost(...) use SWidget::OnFocusLost(...)
		* SWidget::OnKeyboardFocusChanging(...) use SWidget::OnFocusChanging(...)
		* SWidget::OnControllerButtonPressed(...) now routed through SWidget::OnKeyDown(...)
* UGameInstance::InitPIE has been removed and UGameInstance::Init will be called for PIE as well as for standalone.
* This upgrade also includes minor changes to the IHeadMountedDisplayInterface. If you've used this interface, please upgrade your implementation to conform to the new function signatures.
* Removed GVolumeMultiplier and added an equivalent to FApp to contain the code to load the unfocused volume multiplier from config.
* FPrimitiveSceneProxy::GetScene() now returns a reference to the FScene. Lots of code assumes the existance of a scene, so this cements this. Added a check() that the scene is valid when creating the proxy.
* Instead of including Media.h, please include the interface header files that you actually use, i.e. IMediaPlayer.h and/or IMediaTrack.h
* ApplyRequestedMove() has had params reordered and changed; it now includes Friction and Braking, and has all the "out" params at the end.
* Some variables and functions have either been removed or renamed:
	* Removed hacky bGravityEnabled flag from various velocity and acceleration functions.
	* Deprecated old CalculateVelocity() method, renamed to ComputeVelocity() to align with the other functions in the class.
* Deprecated CharacterMovementComponent::AdjustUpperHemisphereImpact() and UpperImpactNormalScale.
	* Implementations of AdjustUpperHemisphereImpact() should override ComputeSlideVector() instead.
* Renamed THRESH_VECTORS_ARE_PARALLEL to THRESH_NORMALS_ARE_PARALLEL, and change the meaning to the cosine of the angle we compare to.
	* Old tolerance was very fuzzy (11.4 degrees), new tolerance is about 1 degree.
* Modified FindAirControlImpact() to distinguish between current and lookahead time, and to take velocity and gravity. However, this function might be deprecated as it is not currently used.
* Removed hacky bGravityEnabled flag from various velocity and acceleration functions.
	* Deprecated old CalculateVelocity() method, renamed to ComputeVelocity() to align with the other functions in the class.
* Some CharacterMovementComponent functions related to air control have been changed to allow more flexibility:
	* GetAirControl() now returns a FVector rather than float, to allow air control code to act non-uniformly (ie different laterally versus forward) if desired.
	* GetFallingLateralAcceleration()/GetAirControl() no longer do the sweep test forward in time to determine if air control should be limited.
	* LimitAirControl() now returns a FVector rather than float. The behavior is now to allow acceleration parallel to the surface in the horizontal plane, or away from the surface altogether.
	* LimitAirControl() may be called multiple times during a falling movement update.
* Users may need to update their AI API function calls.
* Unused parameters removed from FConfigFile::CombineFromBuffer and ProcessInputFileContents
* FConfigFile::ProcessInputFileContents marked CORE_API so as to be callable from other modules
* FAES marked CORE_API so as to be usable from other modules
* All UK2Node GetMenuEntries() functions are deprecated/unused, and have been replaced by GetMenuActions().
* Required Emscripten SDK version is now 1.25. version 1.22 will no longer work.
* Depending on the console variable use you might see a behavior change (watch out for errors in the log). Console variable Set() now needs to specify the priority.
* This shouldn't have been use by any project other than Fortnite.
* Instead of ISettingsEditorModule::GetRef() use FModuleManager::GetModuleChecked("SettingsModule"). Instead of including SettingsEditor.h include the interface headers you actually use.
* Instead of ISettingsModule::Get() use FModuleManager::GetModulePtr("Settings"). Instead of using FSettingsSectionDelegates assign delegates directly through the new ISettingsSection methods.
* SWidget::RenderTransform is now a TOptional.
* FWorkspaceMenuStructure::AssetEditorCategory has been removed and FWorkflowTabFactory::TabIcon is now an FSlateIcon (was previously an FSlateBrush)
	To fix the category, use FAssetEditorToolkit::LocalWorkspaceCategory and set it using FTabManager::AddLocalWorkspaceMenuItem()
	To fix the tab icon, simply use the same icon and style to create an FSlateIcon instead of an FSlateBrush
	Any editor in the engine can be looked to for reference on these changes.

#### Blueprints
* Existing "Equal" nodes for vector/rotator types will be assigned an error tolerance value of "0.0" on load in order to preserve previous behavior that may have been dependent on exact equality.
	* New placements of "Equal" nodes for vector/rotator types will default to the new error tolerance value, and will thus have a "NearlyEquals" type of behavior by default.
* Users that implement their own UK2Nodes will have to port from GetMenuEntries(), and implement GetMenuActions()/GetMenuCategory()/GetNodeTitle(ENodeTitleType::MenuTitle)/GetTooltipText()/GetSignature() to see their nodes properly presented in the new Blueprint menus.

#### Core
* Any non-engine libraries which take or return delegates should be recompiled against the latest engine code to ensure they import/export the correct symbols.
* Variadic delegates will allow binding to arbitrary numbers of arguments or functions with arbitrary arity, but the non-variadic version of delegates - still used by VS2012 - has the same limits as before if you still target that compiler.
	* Bound function arity limit == 8, bound argument limit == 4.
* Manual construction of FPropertyChangedEvent instances should use the one-argument or two-argument form (construction of this type is unlikely to occur in game code though).
* For projects targeting languages other than English, update the Internationalization Preset settings in Project Packaging Settings in order to maintain support for you desired cultures.

#### Framework
* May need to include ActiveSound.h instead of AudioComponent.h if reference FSoundParseParameters
* Added OnFinishedPointerInput(), which gets called after event processing and before GEngine->Tick(). SViewport and FSceneViewport now uses this function instead of ProcessInput() to accumulate high-precision mouse events.
* Any C++ usages of EKeys::Underscore and EKeys::Quote will no longer work as expected and should be switched to EKeys::Hyphen and EKeys::Apostrophe respectively.
* Functions Applying and Getting ComponentInstanceData now take/return FComponentInstanceDataBase* instead of a TSharedPtr
* Any dynamically created components that were explicitly calling InitializeComponent should no longer do so as it is handled via RegisterComponent and will now assert due to InitializeComponent being called multiple times.
* Use FVector::Coincident() if you care about the direction, for cases where FVector::Paralllel() was previously being used.
* Function name will be updated automagically, but resaving BT assets is recommended.

#### Landscape
* Landscape code has been moved out of the Engine module and into its own module.

#### Oculus Rift
* The engine has been upgraded to use the 0.4.3 SDK from Oculus. Please upgrade your runtime installation by downloading the 0.4.3 runtimes from http://developer.oculus.com

#### Physics
* This greatly improves performance. If you have destructible components that interact with the player and you are using an async scene you will need to manually set them to be in the sync scene
* This is now off by default as destruction rarely needs this and it greatly improves performance.

#### Rendering
* A reminder that DrawDynamicElements in subclasses of FPrimitiveSceneProxy will be deprecated in 4.7 and replaced with GetDynamicMeshElements.
* hlslcc*.exe is now replaced by CrossCompilerTool.exe in the Engine binaries folder
* Any code that is directly setting bRenderInMainPass must instead call SetRenderInMainPass( value ).
* Any usage of GRHIFeatureLevel must be replaced with access to world or view's FeatureLevel property.
* r.UseDiffuseSpecularMaterialInput has been removed allowing us to better optimize the g-buffer layout
* The CustomTexture node has been removed completely and any materials that were using CustomTexture with some of the workarounds that worked in some previous versions will need to be modified.
	* A Custom node will now accept a connection from a TextureObject or TextureObjectParameter node instead.
	* If you add a parameter to your Custom node named "MyTex" and connect a TextureObject node, an extra sampler parameter named "MyTexSampler" will be available inside the Custom node's HLSL.
	* You can sample the texture with an HLSL expression such as "Texture2DSample(MyTex,MyTexSampler,UV);"

## Other
* You may experience failure for some old bindings depending on how they were setup. Ensure your bindings are Pure, and the return types match.


## Known Issues
* Cannot create events in the AnimBP EventGraph for new Anim Notifies.
	* Workaround for this issue is to reopen the editor.
