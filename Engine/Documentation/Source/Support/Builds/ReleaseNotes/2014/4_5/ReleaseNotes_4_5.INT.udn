The 4.5 release includes eagerly-awaited features such as animation retargeting, automatic C++ hot reload, light map UV generation and streaming video textures.  New real-time ray traced soft shadows allow for beautifully lit dynamic scenes, and screen-space subsurface scattering enables very realistic skin materials.  Support for mobile platforms and consoles is better than ever, and hundreds of targeted improvements in this release allow complex online games to pass console certification tests.  Finally, creating user interfaces has never been easier now that Unreal Motion Graphics is ready to use!

This release also contains a huge number of usability and learning enhancements, an all new tutorial system, and new game templates for Advanced Vehicles and Twin Stick Shooters.

In this release, more than 40 features and improvements were contributed by our amazing community of developers.  We would like to extend our gratitude the contributors below.

## Major New Features

#### Rendering

##### Ray Traced Distance Field Soft Shadows
There is a new dynamic shadowing method which works by tracing a ray through mesh distance fields to the light. This allows for soft area shadows with sharp contacts! 
 
![](RayTracedDistanceFieldSoftShadows.png)

*Here is a directional light with ray traced soft shadows. Long shadows get softer and self-shadowing in the distance is still detailed.*

![](RayTracedDistanceField03.png)

*Point and spot lights work too. 'Source Radius' is used to control how large the light source is and therefore how large the shadow penumbras are.*


Ray traced shadows can be efficiently computed for longer view distances than traditional cascaded shadow maps (CSM). Distant shadows can be ray traced while nearby shadows are computed with CSM to get the best of both approaches.  

Ray traced shadows are generally 20-30% faster on the GPU than cascaded shadow maps.

These distance fields are the same data used by the Distance Field Ambient Occlusion feature. You can enable it with 'Use RayTraced DistanceField Shadows' on a light, in projects which have the 'Generate Mesh Distance Fields' project setting enabled.

For more information check out the [documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/RayTracedDistanceFieldShadowing/index.html)!

##### Distance Field Ambient Occlusion Improvements

The project rendering setting is now called bGenerateMeshDistanceFields, check that box and restart the editor to use any distance field lighting features.

**Generation**

The distance field generation has been made asynchronous. It will use most of the CPU's cores but leave a few available for using the editor in the meantime.  

![](DistanceFieldAOimprovements01.png)

Meshes no longer need to be closed to support a distance field.

**Specular Occlusion**

We now have some approximate specular occlusion for the sky. The Distance Field AO computation produces a bent normal, which is a cone indicating sky visibility at that point. Intersecting this cone with the reflection cone gives a shadowing term for the sky specular. This prevents leaking near occluders and works best on somewhat rough materials or wherever SSR is not valid due to screen space limitations.

Meshes no longer need to be closed to support a distance field.

*Original*	
![](DistanceFieldAOimprovements02.png)

*With Specular Occlusion*
![](DistanceFieldAOimprovements03.png)

For more information check out the [Distance Field AO documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/DistanceFieldAmbientOcclusion/index.html)!

##### Screen-space Subsurface Scattering 
A new "Subsurface Profile" shading model has been added!  You can use subsurface scattering to create realistic skin materials and other awesome effects.

![](ScreenSpaceSubsurfaceResults.png)
*Left: no subsurface scattering, Right: realistic settings*

##### Dynamic Shadows on Mobile 
Dynamic shadows for movable directional lights are now supported on mobile platforms! Shadows are rendered using cascaded shadow maps with up to two cascades.

### Unreal Motion Graphics (GUI Designer)

Unreal Motion Graphics is now ready to use and available by default! Simply create a new "Widget Blueprint" and start designing your UI.  Of course, new features and improvements are still being added daily.

![](UMGuidesigner.png)


##### UI Render Transforms
Widgets in UMG and Slate can now be translated, rotated, scaled, and sheared! 

![](UIrenderTrans.png)

##### UI Styles
We now allow styling to be done completely inline for a widget's definition. This allows users a much greater control over how widgets look without needing to clutter up their project with several dozen style variations. Styles can now be changed in game, allowing dynamic material instances to be used on any UI!

![](UIstyles.png)


##### UI Animation
UMG now includes more robust animation support.  
* Multiple animations can be created for each widget
* Animations can be controlled at runtime in your widget's blueprint graph
* Keys can now be added to animations automatically via the details panel

![](UIanimation01.png)

UI animations can be controlled in the widget blueprint graph. This is an example of playing an animation when a widget is hovered.

![](UIanimation02.png)

##### DPI Scaling
Unreal Motion Graphics now supports automatic scaling for resolution-independent UI. We now provide default DPI scaling rules for all games. You can configure this in your project's Rendering settings.

![](DPIscaling.png)


#### Programming

##### Automatic C++ Hot Reloading
Unreal Engine now automatically "hot reloads" your C++ gameplay code after you compile in Visual Studio or Xcode!

![](AutoHotReload.png)

No need to shutdown the editor while you're working. Just compile your gameplay code normally from Visual Studio or Xcode, and the engine will apply your C++ changes instantly.

##### Full Game C++ Hot Reload
You can now compile any type of game C++ code without even restarting the editor, and your changes will be applied live!  Even adding whole new classes or properties is supported.

![](FullGameHotReload.png)

### Sample Content

##### Advanced Vehicle Template
The new [Advanced Vehicle template](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Physics/Vehicles/DoubleWishboneVehicle/index.html) shows off a vehicle with double wishbone suspension, and a test track with terrain and many ramps and loops!  It also works great with a VR headset.

![](AdvancedVehicleTemp.png)


##### Twin Stick Shooter Template
The new Twin Stick Shooter template is a perfect starting point for creating fast-paced, top-down shooter games!

![](TwinStickTemp.png)
	

It's a simple template for a Twin Stick shooter where one joystick is used for movement and the other is used to fire in any direction

##### Advanced_Lighting Map
[A new map](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Content/Packs/index.html#advancedlightingmap) is available in the template starter content which provides artists a testing area to try out different lighting setups and see how their content is affected.

![](ArtistTempMap.png)

#### Animation

##### Animation Retargeting System

The new Animation Retargeting System allows you to convert animations between **different skeletons** using the humanoid rig!

![](RetargetingSystem03.png) ![](RetargetingSystem04.png)



Once you have set this up, you will be able to convert animations between any skeleton that uses the same rig.

#### Media Playback and Capture

##### Video Textures (Media Framework)

The new Media Framework allows you to play streaming video on UI widgets and textured objects in your levels!

![](MediaFramework.png)
![](MediaFramework2.png)

Check out our [forum post](https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?46879-Media-Framework-Documentation-for-4-5-Preview) for more information about this new feature.

##### OpenEXR Frame Capture

You can now save rich frame data including HDR colors and 16-bit pixel depth into an OpenEXR file. This is really useful for offline compositing work.

![](OpenEXRFrameCapture.png)

#### Project Creation

##### New Project Creation Window
The **New Project** window has been redesigned to simplify the process of creating new projects!

![](ProjectCreation.png)

##### Target Hardware Selection

You can now select the type of hardware and devices you want to support, and the engine will choose optimal settings for the best player experience! This can be set when creating your project in the **New Project** window or in the Project Settings under Target Hardware. 

![](TargetHardwareSelection.png)

### Learning Resources
In addition to new videos and new written documentation, there are major updates to how you can learn about how to use the editor and access documentation right when you need it! 

##### New Tutorial System
The tutorial system has been completely overhauled in order to provide a more immersive experience! 

![](TakingATutorial2.png)

There are no more popup windows. (Yay!)  Unobtrusive text bubbles overlaid on the editor now walk you through interface elements and various features. The editor will alert you about tutorials you haven't tried, but it never forces you to view anything.

![](TakingATutorial.png)

Once you have decided to take a tutorial, you can **right-click** to see other navigation options (or click the combo arrow in the top-right of the content bubble)

##### Tutorials Browser
There is a fancy new **Tutorials Browser** that provides easy access to all of the tutorials

![](TutorialsBrowser.png)

Tutorials can be accessed from either the Help menu or by clicking the new Tutorials icon in the top-right of the editor. 

##### Tutorials Blueprints
Tutorials are actually now built as Blueprint assets. This means you can create your own in-editor tutorials to include with content published to the Marketplace!

![](TutorialsareBlueprints.png)

Tutorials you create will automatically be visible in the new Tutorial Browser UI.


### Improved In-Editor Help

##### Instant Online Help
You can type into the new Online Help box and the editor will gather as many helpful resources as we can find from the internet. 

![](InstantOnlineHelp.png)

Tutorials, documentation, community wiki, and AnswerHub pages are now all accessible from here! *Note*:  We've moved the in-editor debug console.  You can now press the tilde (~) key to summon the console anywhere within the editor!.

##### New Help Buttons
With lots of new documentation anchors, it's easier to jump directly to reference documentation as you need it in the editor! 

![](NewHelpButtons.png)

##### Documentation Actors
New documentation Actors have been added to sample content that links you to helpful documentation pages.  Check out the updated Content Examples project that includes lots of new help links!

![](DocActors.png)

##### Documentation Nodes
Documentation nodes provide the ability to display documentation snippets in Blueprint graphs. This means you can embed text and images in your graphs to provide information that goes above and beyond the usual comment blocks!

![](DocNodes.png)

##### New Help Tool-tips
Lots of detailed tool-tips have been added all over the editor.  Material nodes, placeable Actors and blueprintable classes now all have rich help when you hover over them with Ctrl+Alt held down.

![](NewHelpTool-tips.png)

#### Documentation 
The [Unreal Engine documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/) now features an updated look which improves readability! In addition, we added search term suggestions to the front page to help you quickly find the topics you are looking for. 

#### Video Tutorial System

The documentation now includes a [video system](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Videos/index.html) for finding and viewing all of our video tutorial series! Everything is organized into categories and videos can easily be viewed as an entire series.

![](VideoTutorialSystem1.png)

#### Unreal Motion Graphics
* New Widget - Scale Box, allows content to be scaled to fit a space with aspect ratio preserving scaling options.
* New Widget - Spin Box, allows direct numeric entry and click-and-drag to change the value.
* New Widget - Grid, allows non-uniform gridded items to be laid out in the designer, with multiple row and column spans.
* New Widget - Size Box, allows you to specify several size rules for the widget and its contents.  Sometimes you just need something to be a certain size, this widget enables that.
* New Widget - String Combo Box, allows for a list of string values to be displayed in a combobox.
* New: Scroll boxes now support horizontal scrolling in Slate and UMG.
* The list of events, both multicast and function bindable events now appear in a single unified list when selecting a widget.
* The designer has a new gizmo that can be used to configure anchor points when positioning content in the canvas panel.
* All widgets now support Render Transforms (Translate, 2D Rotation, Scale, Shear).
* The designer now allows you to move widgets in Layout Transform or Render Transform mode.
* A new SetInputMode() API on the player controller allows more control over how input is routed. Modal UI's and so on will be easier to setup.
* Added grid snapping to the translation layout mode.
* When creating a widget you should use the new Create Widget node.  It works similarly to the Spawn Actor node and allows variables marked as exposed on spawn to be set.

	![](UMGnew01.png)

* We now provide default DPI scaling rules for all Slate/UMG UI in games.  They can be found in your projects Rendering settings, the default setup performs a linear scaling of the UI based on the shortest side's resolution.
* Drag & Drop now has some limited support, though there are still some issues to iron out so that it doesn't create another window to house the dragged content.
* In order to implement it, you'll need at least two different user widgets, a draggable widget, and a widget that will act as the drop target.
* "Aspect Ratio" menu in designer view renamed to "Resolutions."
* All resolutions that match the currently selected one are checked in the Resolutions menu. The current resolution is also displayed in bottom left of designer view.
* Added GetText() to TextBlock.
* Lots of stability improvements. Bindings are no longer run at design time to prevent many of the crashes witnessed in UMG.
* Low level input handling is now possible in UMG widgets, you'll need to override the mouse/controller/keyboard functions and handle the input there.
* The game viewport now disables throttling when it contains focus so that Slate UI in the game doesn't trigger throttling in the editor, meaning interacting with Slate or UMG UI in your game will no longer cause the editor to stop updating.
* Changing all BlueprintImplementableEvents to BlupeprintNativeEvent on the UUserWidget so that native implementations can handle those events as well.
* Palette now properly displays all other Widget Blueprints in the project.
* The progress bar now has clean clipping lines when displaying the progress image.  It no longer scales the paint geometry, it instead scales the clipping rect, it does this for everything except for FillFromCenter, where the only reasonable thing to do is scale the paint geometry, otherwise a sphere image would be filled using a square.  Additionally, I've added Fill directions for TopToBottom and BottomToTop.
* Slate color details customization now has a way to toggle the 'Use Foreground' flag using the new 'Iinherit' checkbox.
* TextBlocks now have text justification.
* Improving the anchors drop down menu to show a preview of the effect it has.
* Anchor points can now be animated.
* Fixed a few cases where widget functions did not appear in the graph when "Context Sensitive" was enabled.


#### Paper 2D
* New: Added debug rendering for pawn/visibility collision on sprites.
	* Added support for VMI_CollisionVisibility and VMI_CollisionPawn view modes to FPaperRenderSceneProxy

	![](ShowPlayerCollision2D.png)

* New: Sprites can now affect navmesh generation.

	![](SpritesAffectingNavmesh.png)

* New: Support for defining or querying sockets on flipbook assets and components.
	* Current implementation passes thru sockets defined on each source frame and does not allow authoring directly in the flipbook editor, but it is otherwise fully functional
* New: Improved material support on UPaperFlipbook assets and components.
	* Converted UPaperFlipbookComponent to derive from UMeshComponent, allowing materials to overridden at runtime or via Blueprints.
	* Added a default material to UPaperFlipbook assets and changed the Material override in UPaperFlipbookComponent to default to null.
		* This should have no impact on existing content, but allows flipbooks to have a material set once and show up correctly inside of the flipbook editor, rather than requiring it to be set on each instance.
* New: Added support for a negative play rate on flipbook components.
* New: Added support for choosing project-wide default materials that will be applied to newly created sprites.
	* Combine various InitSprite variants into one function that takes an init parameters object.
* New: Moved Paper2D plugin out of Experimental folder, as only a few parts of it are still experimental.
* New: Expose RenderComponent to Blueprints in APaperFlipbookActor and APaperSpriteActor, and add 'pass-thru' metadata so various functions can be called on the component from an Actor reference.
* New: Added DLL export to UPaperSpriteComponent and APaperCharacter
* New: Added support for manually creating sprites with holes in render geometry.
* New: Added class comments to APaperSpriteActor and UPaperSpriteComponent, remove EarlyAccessPreview flag from UPaperSpriteComponent
* New: Flipbooks are now created automatically by auto-detecting and grouping names from selection or sprite sheets.
* Sprite source region edit mode workflow has been improved, slice up sprites quickly by ctrl-dragging rectangles.
* Fixed: Sockets are now drawn at correct location in the sprite editor when pixels/uu is not 1.0
* Fixed: Socket gizmo manipulation speed is now correct when pixels/uu is not 1.0
* Fixed: Sprites no longer have swapped vertex color channels on iOS and Android devices
	* Converted FPaperSpriteVertex and FMaterialSpriteVertex to use FColor instead of FLinearColor
	* Added check() in FLocalVertexFactory to enforce the assumption that the ColorComponent is VET_Color
* Fixed: Contact filtering was not being correctly applied in Box2D prototype (also fixes a crash in debug when using Box2D)
* Implemented Geometry editor usability improvements.

#### Behavior Trees

* Right-click menu operations on Behavior Tree sub-nodes now work.
* Updated Blackboard view when Blackboard is edited in Blackboard mode.
* Undo & Redo now properly affect Blackboard entries
* Fixed crash on shutdown when editing behavior trees.
* Fixed Behavior Tree details was not scrolling when the details panel was larger than the tab.
* Fixed crash selecting enum Blackboard key value when enum was invalid.

#### FBX 
* Importing: Fixed the crash happening when there is multiple roots for the skeletalmesh and importing multiple times.
* Importing: Fixed issue with importing lesser frame for animation.
* Exporting: Mesh/Skeleton are not grouped any more under BaseNode.
* Exporting: Animation now exports time correctly.

* We no longer prompt to reset the transaction buffer during package cleanup after an object is deleted.
* Working to stave off circular Blueprint dependency issues (cutting down one destabilizes another)... working on a full-fledged solution now.
* Array properties with external Blueprint dependencies were not being fully loaded prior to generating the Blueprint class on load; fixed.
* Blueprint assets containing a native component attachment were incorrectly being marked as needing to be saved upon opening; fixed.

* Made various node padding values adjustable to iterate on more compact nodes (WIP).
* Removed some redundant code from SGraphNodeK2Event::AddPin, relying on the inherited behavior except for delegate pins
* When class properties in Blueprints are missing their classes (because they were removed, etc), we replace those class references with an Object class reference, so they can be fixed up.

* New: Added shading model SubsurfaceProfile, can specify new SubsurfaceProfile asset on the material or material instance uses SeparableSSS by Jorge Jimenez and Diego Gutierrez.
* New: Added warning to renderer settings when a property is not found or set to read-only (read-only isn't always an error since it still gets written to the ini file, it just won't take effect until the next run)
* Distance Field Ambient Occlusion Improvements
	* Asynchronous generation, meshes no longer have to be closed.
	* Resulting bent normal is also used to occlude skylight specular using an approximate cone-cone intersection.

	* Supports point, spot and directional lights, once bUseRayTracedDistanceFieldShadows has been enabled.
	* Point and spot lights use SourceRadius to control penumbra size, DirectionalLight uses LightSourceAngle.
	* Ray traced shadows on a directional light cover up to DistanceFieldShadowDistance, and can complement CSM by handling the distant shadows.
* New: SM4 feature level now supports reflection captures on translucency.
* New: Added support for Sky Lights on Mobile.

	* GetDynamicMeshElements is const and must not modify the proxy, update work should be pushed to the proxy from the game thread.  
	* GetDynamicMeshElements can be called on views that are not in the view family, which allows a proper view for shadow depth passes.
* Improved display names and tooltips for some rendering project settings.
* Indirect Lighting Cache improvements (character indirect lighting)
	* Primitives default to interpolating a single point, overall indirect lighting cache update time is 4x less.

This feature allows you to create a copy of animation asset to retarget for different skeleton using copy and/or modifying animation itself. If the bone name matches, you don't have to use rig system. If bone names don't match, you'll have to use new "rig" system. If it's humanoid, please use engine Humanoid Rig. If it is not possible, you can create rig from any skeleton, and make sure both skeleton shares the same rig. Then you'll be able to retarget correctly. Check more for documentation.

* APlayerController::GetMousePosition now returns false when a mouse is not attached.
* Attachment replication now takes into account RelativeScale3D.
* SimulatedRootMotionPositionFixup: handle zero play rate, and better communicate "Server ahead of Client" pre-requisite.

	* FName is now case-preserving when WITH_CASE_PRESERVING_NAME is true.
	* You can no longer assume that sizeof(FName) is 8-bytes (you can use FMinimalName if you have code that requires an 8-byte name, however this should only be used if the code cannot otherwise be updated).
	* FName no longer has GetIndex(), it has GetComparisonIndex() and GetDisplayIndex() instead.
* Added "-WaitForDebugger" command-line option.
	* When specified, non-shipping UE4 programs will pause at startup until a debugger becomes attached.
	* Very useful for remote debugging code that executes at startup time (such as a plugin's StartupModule function).
* Added an ensure >0 to FBlueprintCoreDelegates::SetScriptMaximumLoopIterations
* Added compiler version logging at engine startup.
	* Detects both Clang and Visual C++, prints version information to log.

	* If specified during a patch generation operation, only existing data aged less than the supplied parameter (in days) will be considered for reuse
	* If specified during a compactify operation, only data aged more than the supplied parameter (in days) will be eligible for deletion
	* These changes have been made to allow for concurrent patch generation and compactify operations on the same cloud directory, during which patch generation should have a lower threshold than compactify.
* Exposed UNavigationSystem::OnNavigationBoundsUpdated for BP use and changed the param to a more specific ANavMeshBoundsVolume type.
* FName is now case-preserving in the editor and UHT.
	* This addresses a number of issues where asset, Actor, blueprint component, or variable names could not have mistyped names corrected when they differed only by case, or could cause UHT to generate code that would not compile.
* Implemented a generic BTTask for making AI face given BB entry.
* Improved error message when GGameName (derived from the .uproject name) mismatches the GameName key in the [URL] section of DefaultGame.ini

* **UnrealMath**
	* Added RotationAboutPointMatrix
	* Added static Make() methods for the various derived FMatrix types. 
		* Allows single expressions that return an FMatrix instead of derived type constructors that rely on implicit conversion..
	* Simplified the implementation of FQuat::MakeFromEuler.
	* Implemented GetTypeHash for FVector4 and FLinearColor.
* **TransformCalculus Framework**
	* Provides a uniform set of operations for classes that can be used as a spatial transform.
	* Allows users to focus on intent and not math when working with spatial hierarchies like rigid bodies, etc.
	* See documentation in TransformCalculus.h
	* Provides a full suite of conforming transform types for 2D transformations:
		* FVector2D
		* FScale2D

		* FMatrix
		* FRotator


**Unreal Header Tool**
* UnrealHeaderTool now supports C++11 scoped enums, aka. 'enum class'
* Clarified a couple of error messages that sounded like keywords were limited to only multicast delegate properties (when they are also applicable to functions)

**Unreal Build Tool**
* New: UnrealBuildTool now starts up more quickly (faster C++ iteration times).
* New: Unreal Build Tool now display friendly action descriptions when compiling locally on Windows platform.
* UnrealBuildTool macros are now consistent across configurations.
* UnrealBuildTool now gets the cl.exe from the executable itself rather than the registry, for better compatibility with non-Professional editions of Visual Studio.
* Now it deletes old and unnecessary hot-reload PDBs.
* RPC UFunctions will now generate virtual  X_Validate() functions so they can be overloaded if the function itself is virtual.
* Fixed detection of hot-reload compilation if other UE4Editor process was running in the system.

**Project Versions**
* Solution files created for GitHub builds of the engine now set the game to as the active project by default.
* New VS2012 projects now include default command line arguments for all projects.
* UnrealVersionSelector now prompts to browse for an engine installation if an existing one is not found.
* Registering shell extensions now fixes up any stale user overrides for file associations.
* UnrealBuildTool now correctly handles user-supplied resource files, and will ignore PCLaunch.rc when they are present.
* UnrealVersionSelector now warns when trying to generate projects for content-only games.

**Stats**
* New: There is a new stats page for Cooker Statistics in StatsViewer
* StatsViewer: Now shows hyperlinked arrays of objects
* Added a command 'stat display' which may be used to change various stats display settings
* Updated comment regarding stats commands exec.
* Fixed minor memory leak.

**Profiler**
* Fixed FPS Chart not working in the previous version.

**Crash Report (probably not very useful for licenses or rocket users)**
* Crash report receiver is now more reliable, requires less maintenance work.

**Crash report client**
* Added analytics to the crash report client

**Crash report website**
* Added an option to filter buggs by the build version/ or by the crash type
* Added displaying the MachineID/EpicID
* Added ErrorMessage to the website, error message can contain following values: description from asserts, description from ensures, description from fatal errors or can be empty for unhandled exceptions

**Hot-Reload**
* Hot-Reload now supports structural changes to UObject-derived classes. It's no longer disallowed to add/remove new properties and classes for hot-reload.
* Hot-Reload from IDE: when compiling game target that's currently open in the editor from Visual Studio, the editor will automatically perform hot-reload after compilation has finished.
* After hot-reload all default class object will be re-created to match the changes made to the default values.
* When performing Hot-reload when the target project is up-to-date, no new DLLs will be produced, thus reducing iteration times.

#### Slate UI System
* New: Multitouch is now supported for mouse capture in Slate and UMG.  Actions like pressing and holding a button, while pressing a different button now functions correctly
* New: 2D render transforms have been added to Slate. Render transforms allow short, transitional effects for a widget without affecting how it is laid out. They support a complete set of 2D affine transforms (translation, rotation, shear, scale, mirroring).
* New: Added image support to rich text editing.
* MultiLineEditableText can now be used to edit rich-text (there's a demo in SlateViewer)
* TextBlock and SpinBox now support a minimum desired width for layout.
Added a SerializeFromMismatchedTag to FSlateColor that can convert an FColor or FLinearColor property to an FSlateColor.
Implemented scrolling for SMultiLineEditableText.
STextBlock can now specify a justification, margin, and line height percentage.
SRichTextBlock now takes its text and highlight text as an attribute.
SEditableText, SEditableTextBox, SMultiLineEditableText, and SMultilineEditableTextBox now automatically work with virtual keyboards on mobile devices. Currently only single-line entry is supported.
* SWindow changes
	* Added GetLocalToScreenTransform. (Screen space == Desktop space)
	* Added GetLocalToWindowTransform (Window space == Desktop space without the window offset)
	* Added GetClientRectInScreen
* Added three texture atlasing padding styles:
	* NoPadding - don't apply any padding (used to be Padding == 0).
	* DilateBorder - copy border edges to apply 1-pixel padding (used to be Padding == 1).
	* PadWithZero - expand 1-pixel border and fill it with zeros (new style).
* Removed incomplete support for Padding > 1. It wasn't useful as we don't support mips or aniso filtering.
	* FontCache now uses PadWithZero padding to improve the appearance of zoomed text.
* FSlateRect updates
	* Added support for the new transform calculus framework (TransformRect).
	* Added new members GetBottomRight() and OffsetBy().
	* Added FromPointAndExtent() factory function
	* Made the default/4-float ctor explicit.
* Added FSlateRotatedRect
	* Supports FSlateRect-like functionality, but for parallelograms induced by render transforms (scale/shear/mirror).
	* Also added IsUnderLocation() and ToBoundingRect() for overlap testing.
* Slate now uses Round instead of Trunc to snap to integer pixel coordinates. Snapping only occurs on final vertex creation now.
* Added a ScissorRectBox widget that ensures child widgets are clipped even under render transforms by using hardware scissor rect.
	* Scissor Rects can be nested. A widget is clipped by scissor of the most recent predecessor.
	* Expect a performance impact beyond the hardware overhead as this affects batching similar to painting to different layers.
* Fixed SScrubWidget::OnPaint drawing the draggable bars with an incorrect offset.
* Fixed crash when using SLATE_TEXT_ATTRIBUTE with a delegate that had become invalid.
* Fixed crash when pressing return in a read-only text box.
* Fixed some wrapping issues when using multi-line text with an STextBlock.
* Fixed issue where the bar of a Slider widget did not appear on mobile devices.
* Fixed crash when re-styling zero-length text runs

#### Audio
* New: Sound Class for VOIP audio component can now be specified via the audio project settings.
* Enabled Audio Streaming options behind a new setting in the 'Experimental' section of preferences
* Added Audio setting to restrict the amount of streaming sounds that can play concurrently.
* Ensured that additional channels for multichannel sounds can be imported correctly.
* Ensured that new sounds started via 'Play Sound Attached' would be audible before playing.
* Fixed problem with Parameter controlled Crossfade SoundNode.
* Exposed Audio Component for the Buggy engine in the Vehicle sample.
* Added search capability to key selection boxes.
* Moved Streaming Manager update out of the expensive tasks section.

#### Platforms
**Mac**
* Improved drag and drop between windows on Mac. Inactive window will not activate on mouse down if the cursor is over a draggable item.
* Added pragma to treat deprecation attribute as warning, not error, on Mac.
* For the benefit of OS X implement support for APPLE_client_storage & APPLE_texture_range and use them for non-renderable textures to eliminate the cost of Lock/Unlock and RHIAsyncReallocateTexture2D.
	* This only works with uncompressed textures, but helps avoid very slow, synchronous calls to glGetTexImage despite using PBOs. This does not increase memory overhead as client-storage textures use the backing store we provide for the GL engine copy.
* Wrap OpenGL texture deletion calls so that on OS X DeleteTextures pools the texture names into one of three buffers so that textures are deleted at least two frames after their last use, this amortises the cost of deleting the textures.
	* The texture deletion occurs after flushBuffer in BlitToViewport and the min/max number of textures to delete in a single invocation can be overidden by the r.Mac.MinTexturesToDeletePerFrame & r.Mac.MaxTexturesToDeletePerFrame.
* Wrap glFlush so that on OS X we always call glFlushRenderAPPLE which is faster, while still sufficient for these calls.
* Warn Mac users that attempt to run on Macs with OpenGL 3.3 GPUs as they aren't fully supported also warn Mac users whose GPUs are below the recommended minimums that they may encounter low performance. 
* Added warnings for running with less than the recommended amount of memory or on a dual-core rather than quad-core processor as they also make a big difference.
* Initial work to fix fullscreen mode on OS X properly - these changes make it possible to use 'proper' fullscreen mode which respects the chosen resolution for games where the mouse cursor is hidden. 
	* The default remains as WindowedFullcreen as these changes don't address the difference in mouse & display coordinate systems that results from using OS X's scaled fullscreen mode.
* Implemented support for saving open documents in Xcode via the XcodeSourceAccessor using Applescript & fixed the XcodeSourceAccessor's display name.
* Rewrote Mac OS X crash reporting to output the minidump information in Apple Crash Report format, which is then parsed by the new code in CrashDebugHelper into our diagnostic display format.
	* Symbolisation is now implemented using CoreSymbolication, atos is no longer required meaning we don't require Xcode be installed.
	* Symbolisation now only happens within the CrashReportClient, not the crashed app, so the crash handling is async. handler safe.
	* More useful information is now provided in the logs.
* Used a pre-configured malloc zone allocator instead of the current allocator once execution enters the async. signal handler on Mac OS X so that UE4 doesn't become unkillable if it crashes.
* Fixed various crashes and other Mac specific issues.
* On OS X detach the game thread from the 'blessed' Cocoa main thread. 
	* Cocoa isn't an event-polling API as UE4 expects, so we separate the threads to emulate that behaviour. 
	* This means less spinning-beachball-of-doom when loading levels or cooking, etc. which made some windows unusable on OS X.
	* It also allows us to take steps to ensure the event ordering Slate demands, but OS X doesn't always provide.
* Implemented support for Distcc + DMUCs as an alternative to XGE on Mac OS X.
	* By either manually configuring distcc & DMUCS as per their documentation, or using the DistCode Xcode plugin compilation can be distributed amongst networked Macs.
	* All Macs must have the same developer tools installed & the same distcc/DMUCS/DistCode and be on the same local network.
	* This works for compiling for Mac & iOS and it should be possible to configure distcc & DMUCS manually for use on build farms for remote building from Windows.
* Implemented optional & off-by-default support for automatic graphics switching on OS X, rather than just relying on the OS, with a GUI plugin for the editor.
	* Adds DisplayMask for setting an explicit display mask, RendererID for the initially preferred rendering device, bUseMultipleRenderers to allow desktops to use multiple GPUs for blitting to the screen and bAllowAutomaticGraphicsSwitching to allow laptops with automatic graphics switching support to switch between discrete & integrated GPUs which provide the same OpenGL version.
	* The plugin provides an editor preferences panel & for laptops using bAllowAutomaticGraphicsSwitching a live drop-down in the LevelEditor window to select the current GPU.

**Android**
* Experimental support for OpenGL ES 3.1 + Android Extension Pack as seen in the "Rivalry" demo at this year's Google I/O.

If using separate, Launch On will query the connected device for the best match. This is pretty early, so we are interested in feedback!
* Added concept of r.MobileContentScaleFactor CVar (in DeviceProfiles) with a value of 0, meaning native resolution.
* Added libgnustl_shared.so to APK during packaging (not on all Android devices).
* Added cxa_demangle for x86 Android.
* Changed GetCurrentThreadId on Android to use gettid() instead of pthread_self() to handle 64-bit.
* Got rid of duplicate log messages on Android.
* Updated x86 PhysX libs for Android.
* Enabled ICU on Android. Added scripts for building ICU for Android.

* New: iPhonePackager now filters out expired mobile provisions and signing certificates
	* Added checking of validity dates on mobile provisions and signing certificates, choosing only ones that are currently valid
	* Added extended logging for found mobile provisions and signing certificates, to help debug possible provisioning issues in the future
	* Removed duplicated Apple chain certificates from DotNET/IOS and switch to using the ones in Engine/Build/IOS
	* Various other output logging improvements and time stamps during code signing
	* Removed rotted -interactive option and associated code
	* Fixed unused variable warning on mono

* Added a new delegate to to IOnlineIdentity, OnControllerPairingChanged, which fires when the Xbox event fires.
* ShooterGame now handles controller disconnections to comply with XRs.
* Shader PDB generation is now supported for better debugging in PIX. To activate this, add the following text to your game's DefaultEngine.ini file, substituting the path for where you want the shader PDB files to be placed. The directory must be one that can be written to from non-administrator level processes. You may need to change the GUID in ShaderVersion.usf to force a rebuild of the shaders.

		[DevOptions.Shaders]
		ShaderPDBRoot=D:\DirectoryOfChoice

* SSE math functions added (from the Windows implementation).
* Xbox now fires FCoreDelegates::OnControllerConnectionChange when a controller connection changes.
* Xbox One MP4 movie player plugin has been added.
* Added /ZW compiler option for libraries, so that plugins can use the entire XDK.
* Changed thread affinities so that worker threads never share the core that the main game thread is on.
* Log files are now flushed to disk when suspending the title.
* Removed unnecessary SetRenderTarget() call from BeginRenderFrame() to fix incorrect timings.
* Removed MEM_TITLE from any VirtualAlloc calls that use MEM_GRAPHICS, as this is unnecessary.
* Fixed the shader constant ring buffer using too much memory. This fix also causes a minor performance increase.
* Fixed multiple potential crashes in the Live online subsystem.


**PlayStation 4**
* Devkit/TestKit detection to allow running of development builds on test kits.
* Initial support for OnChip Geometry Shaders. Currently disabled due to an outstanding issue.
* Optional buffered occlusion queries console variable to eliminate all occlusion query readback stalls on CPU. Adds latency to occlusion results. 
* PS4 flip management completely overhauled. No more explicit CPU stall at the end of the frame for a flip. Flip management now handled entirely by the GPU.

* Fixed crash that can happen when splitscreen players leave.
* Fixed issue where Controller property wasn't replicating to non owners, but needs to when the value is NULL.     	
* Fix for the network GUIDissue during seamless travel when we flush guids on the server. The quick fix is to not even send this property to the server, since we don't need to. This has the added benefit of not only fixing the issue, but saves bandwidth. We still need to look into letting guids persist on the server for a bit longer to rully resolve any future conflicts that could happen.
* Lower verbosity on rejected RPC's. This really isn't an error, and more by design.
* Fixed PIE crash when simulating with the "use dedicated server" option checked

	* This analytics provider sends the data to Apsalar's cloud service (see [www.apsalar.com](https://apsalar.com/ for more details)).
	* This plugin requires information from your Apsalar account to send the analytics events.

#### Physics
* Fixed Use GetUnitAxis instead of GetScaledAxis inside FConstraintInstance::SetRefFrame

* Fixes for adding splitscreen players to the Live session.
* Make sure OwningUserId is set correctly when creating sessions.
* Enable seamless travel for shootergame.
* Fixed duplicate calls to CleanupSessionOnReturnToMenu on the client when the server leaves the game.  Fixes crash from a check() on duplicate delegate adds.
* Fixed bug where the 'switch user' feature could be used to have the wrong user control a LocalUser.
* Fix for letting users through menu when network is disconnected.
* ShooterLocalPlayer now passes in the FPlatformUserId to the ShooterPersistentUser
* Send Xbox events on clients and when users quit mid-match to the main menu.
* Only show the "invite players" in-game menu option if it's an online game.
* Set online mode when accepting invites so that party operations work correcty (fixes invites not working in some cases).

* Rename players which share the login for offline play.
* Fixed a bug where the second controller couldn't join a game.
* Fixed a bug where trying to search for LAN games would lock you out of searching for any games until you restarted.
* Set up join game flow to handle/process arbitrary errors.
* Cable pull handling.
* Fixed issue where the map's navmesh wasn't being registered during seamless travel, because ANavigationData::PostInitializeComponents would MarkPendingKill itself if the world didn't have a navigation system yet.
* Fixed a case where two in-game menus could appear on top of each other.
* Voice chat implementation/UI is now being displayed in the Scoreboard UI in-game. Also added speaker icon to display via slate.

* Fixed issue where a player got into a bad state if the in-game menu was open when the round transitioned.
* End of round scoreboard is now interactive and can be used to bring up players gamercards.
* Don't call HostGame when hosting a quick match, the session has already been created.
* Added/removed local users to/from the party (required for Xbox One) in Shooter online games.

* OSS - A client now correctly leaves the room when they leave the game, and can thus rejoin.
* OSS - If joining a room fails, the user will now leave the session they just joined as well.
* OSS - Fixing issue where sessions were incorrectly getting set as LobbySessions.
* OSS - Implemented GetUserPrivilege.
* OSS - General fix for Session Failure states where delegates weren't getting cleared properly and thus asserted when the next attempt was made.
* OSS - If a session fails to create, it will remove the NamedSession from the list.
* OSS - Fix for crash if a player logs out while in-game.
* OSS - Fixed issue where sessions were not getting removed from the internal list if the game ended via someone signing out.
* OSS - Fixed issue where no network play could ever be done if the game was started while controller 0 was not signed into PSN.
* OSS - Fixed issue where UserWebApiContext was erroneously getting created even if the user was not logged into PSN, which resulted in caching a bad value that would later destroy all the things.
* OSS - Fixed bug where the wrong contextId was being used on PS4.

**Networking**
* Allowed overriding max players via console command to allow testing full servers (net.MaxPlayersOverride).
* Set the PlayerName in APlayerState::OverrideWith (Names can change between connects, this prevents showing an old, incorrect name if an inactive player was found).
* Compare unique net ids on console in AGameMode::FindInactivePlayers to eliminate false positives.
* Added ChangeTeam() and SwapTeam() code to UPartyBeacon implementation
* Added InactivePlayerStateLifeSpan variable to AGameMode to allow for game customization for the amount of time an inactive player is allowed to remain in the inactive players list
* Added a null check against FUniqueNetId in Login debug output
* Refactored Login() code to create a cleaner relationship between Login() and PostLogin()
	* InitNewPlayer() will register player, set name and other basic Login initialization, it shouldn't be overloaded by the game as its still too early for game changes
	* Typically game code should start affecting the logged in player with PostLogin()
* Fixed: False negative when comparing FUniqueNetId's. This fixes guests not working on XB1.
	* Overriding FUniqueNetId on ULocalPlayer is now allowed. This is so we can decouple controller id, and OSS identity.               
	* This is necessary for platforms that need to allow overriding the controller while still maintaining the original user for achievements, etc.
* Shootergame - Wrapped PlayerOwner pointers with TWeakObjectPtr's.


## Upgrade Notes

#### Editor and Tools
* Large refactor was done to the Project Launcher (formerly Game Launcher). Launch profiles will need to be recreated.
* Cleaned up of WorldSettings, some properties are marked as 'advanced' and other are hidden.
* C++ header links are no longer shown in SceneOutliner. as it was hard to read. Is still available via Details when Actor is selected.
* The SlateApplicationBase::GetMouseCaptor() is now deprecated. Check if a specific widget has mouse capture using the SWidget::HasMouseCapture() method.
* Renamed 'Create Copy' to 'Duplicate' in Content Browser.
* The notion of category icons has been removed from the API. If you're registering a settings category, you should remove the icon and update your code.

#### Slate
* SLATE_TEXT_ATTRIBUTE now uses an FText attribute rather than an FString attribute.
	* Note: SLATE_TEXT_ATTRIBUTE is legacy and should not be used in new code - if you're using it, please consider using a normal FText attribute instead.
* Slate Widget Render Transforms
	* FGeometry's AbsoluteToLocal, LocalToAbsolute, and IsUnderLocation have been updated to use the render transform.
* Added FSlateLayoutTransform (using new transform calculus framework) to store a 2D translation and uniform scale for FGeometry.
* Slate slots now have a common base and stricter access to private members:
	* The .Widget property on Slots has been removed in favor of GetWidget()
	* Assign the slot content by invoking operator[]();e.g. (*MySlotPtr)[ContentToSet ]
	* TPanelChildren and TSlotlessChildren now only support a subset of the Array API.
* The AspectRatio() property in Slate has been deprecated.
* SColorPicker and SWizard moved into new module AppFramework. Please update your Build.cs file if you're using these widgets!
* Replaced embossed 3D borders with flat borders. If you're using borders as a padding mechanism, consider SBox instead.
* Fixed an issue where FPointerEvent::CursorDelta was calculated backwards for touch events. Any user created widgets that use this constructor and negated CursorDelta to get proper behavior will now scroll/slide backwards. Fix this by removing the negation to FPointerEvent::CursorDelta where necessary.
* **FGeometry Breaking Changes**
	* To support Render Transforms for widgets, some breaking changes were made to FGeometry:
	* Made all public members const to prevent mutating uses of them.
		* Instead of mutating FGeometry, prepare the necessary values in advance and call FGeometry::MakeChild().    
	* Removed FGeometry::CenteredPaintGeometryBelow() and GetRect().
	* Direct member access to FGeometry will eventually be going away.
		* Replace direct member access with calls to appropriate member functions instead.
	* FPaintGeometry should no longer be constructed directly to properly support render transforms.
		* Instead call FGeometry::ToPaintGeometry().
		* Existing usages will not break, but they will not support render transforms.
	* Removed FPaintGeometry::ToSlateRect() and Identity().

**Unreal Motion Graphics**
* Button Click Bindings from 4.4 won't work out of the box in 4.5! Due to a design change, the UMG Button no longer uses a function binding to register the click events. It now uses a standard Blueprint Multicast Event for performing the click Broadcast. You will need to setup a new handler for this event, then call your old function, or move the logic into the event graph. **NOTE**: There was another bug associated with function bindings, they were all accidentally generated as pure, so you will need to uncheck the pure checkbox in order to invoke your function.

* We now provide a DPI Scaling system for all Slate Game UI. If you already have one you should remove it or configure this one to have a scale of 1 so that they don't both add to the scale of the UI. See New Features for more details on the system.
* If you were using the low level overridable input functions that expected the FSReply (now called FEventReply), the way that structure is built has changed a lot to mirror much more closely what is possible with Slate. For example, if you want to have a widget that captured the mouse on mouse down, you could do it like so now:

	![](UMG02.png)

* The old Drag/Drop panels have been removed in favor of a different approach to drag/drop.
* To create widgets in the past you had to use the "Create Widget" function. This has been replaced by a new custom node with the same name, Create Widget has many more capabilities, and it always returns the type specified, so you no longer need to Cast a widget you just created! Your old usage should continue to work, but you're encouraged to change over to this new node.
* Several unfinished experimental widgets have been hidden until their time comes. Viewport, List View, Tile View, ComboBox, ScrollBar are no longer creatable in the designer.
* The Slate Widget Style assets no longer apply to UMG. You can use them in a few places in blueprint scripts, but they are no longer the means by which you style widgets. Existing styles will be copied over, however we now store a copy of all style data directly on the widgets.  We do this so that you can freely mutate the style of any widget at runtime, giving them dynamic material instances and just generally changing their look and feel based on user input.
* Added To Viewport - Modal, Show Cursor and Absolute Layout flags have been removed!  Absolute Layout is now automatically determined if you manually attempt to position/size it after placing it in the viewport. Cursor and Modal options are now controlled through the Player Controller with the new function "Set Input Mode".

#### Rendering
* DrawDynamicElements in subclasses of FPrimitiveSceneProxy will be deprecated soon and replaced with GetDynamicMeshElements.  
* Progress on parallel rendering, mostly focused on consoles. For non-consoles, r.RHICmdBypass 0 enables the parallel prototype. That also works on consoles, but togglerhithread enables the full set of parallel optimizations. This remains experimental work in progress, but show promising gains.
* Post processing lens flare defaults have been changed (off by default as project setting) and your existing projects might have lens flares that formerly have been switched off by post process settings. The post process setting can be fixed or the new project setting can be used.
* Removed UI Blur (has issues and complicated the engine internals).
* The r.MobileHDR console variable is now read-only during execution.
* Fixed "ApplyDBufferData adding .5 to spec brightness?", was affecting specular brightness if DBuffer is enabled.
* ERHIFeatureLevel::Type enumeration entry SM3 was removed, and ES3_1 was added
	* Any tests for ERHIFeatureLevel::SM3 should be changed to ERHIFeatureLevel::SM4
	* Any tests for ERHIFeatureLevel::ES2 should be changed to ERHIFeatureLevel::ES3_1

#### Blueprints
* Evaluate Curve Table Row Blueprint node: Added a drop down box for selecting row name, but you may have to delete and recreate any existing nodes to see this change. New nodes should work fine.
* Kismet library headers are no longer globally included.
* Prevented GetPlayerController, GetPlayerPawn, GetPlayerCharacter, GetPlayerCameraManager, CreatePlayer being called in ConstructionScript.
* Users should port their own K2Node GetMenuEntries() implementations over into UK2Node::GetMenuActions() (in preparation for 4.6)
	* We've been refactoring the blueprint menuing system, which is slated to go live in 4.6. To circumvent hiccups when this happens, please duplicate any GetMenuEntries() logic you may have, and move it over into a UK2Node::GetMenuActions() override.
	* The ui portion of these menu items will be almost exclusively defined through overrides to UK2Node's GetNodeTitle(ENodeTitleType::MenuTitle)/GetMenuCategory()/GetTooltipText()/GetKeywords()/GetPaletteIcon() functions.
	* You can preview the experimental menu system by switching on the "Use New Blueprint Menuing System" option in the editor's experimental preferences.
* Deprecated the old UEdGraphNode::CanPasteHere(), the replacement version just takes a UEdGraph pointer (and utilizes the new UEdGraphNode ::IsCompatibleWithGraph() function)
* Deprecated UEdGraphNode::GetTooltip(), now replaced with UEdGraphNode::GetTooltipText() (which returns a localized text string)

#### Animation
* Refactored Montage API to support multi-montages.

#### Gameplay and Framework
* Added ENGINE_API to CurveFloat class to make it available outside of engine. (Required to access various vehicle parameters).
* AActor::GetRootPrimitiveComponent deprecated.  Use GetRootComponent and cast as appropriate.
* Actor lifespan timers now started in BeginPlay not PostInitializeComponents
* AGameMode::SetGameMode deprecated, use AGameMode::GetGameModeClass instead
* AGameMode::GetGameModeClass and GetDefaultGameClassPath are now const and virtual
* BlueprintCallable functions that require a WorldContext should now use the metadata WorldContext=<ParameterName> instead of DefaultToSelf=<ParameterName> and HidePin=<ParameterName>
	* ShowHiddenSelfPins class metadata has been changed to ShowWorldContextPin
	* Functions that require a WorldContext are no longer placeable in graphs for classes that do not implement GetWorld() and are not marked ShowWorldContextPin
	* Functions that would like a WorldContext, but can function without (for example PrintString) can also supply the CallableWithoutWorldContext metadata to allow placement in all contexts
* Component/Actor mouse over updates will now fire while the game is paused.
* Enabled virtual sticks for twin stick template.
* FVector2D UGameViewport::GetMousePosition() deprecated and replaced by bool GetMousePosition(FVector2D&) which returns false when the mouse cursor is not over the viewport
* Improved VR device support in vehicle templates.
* General improvements to vehicle templates.
* General cleanup  of template levels.
* Navigation octree was refactored to simplify ownership of collision data. Actor.UpdateNavigationRelevancy() function is removed, please use Actor.IsComponentRelevantForNavigation() to disable collision export. All objects exporting navigation data should use INavRelevantInterface interface.

* Fixed sub 1080 menus in Strategy Game menus
* Fixed issue with keyboard in twin stick code template 
* Fixed gamma setting not being applied in Shooter Game. 
* Fixed crash in Shooter Game instance when running dedicated server. 

#### Core
* Couple of NavigationSystem's bookkeeping functions have been hidden from public use.
* EQS generators and Tests has been refactored to use virtual functions rather then delegates to perform their work.
* FPImplRecastNavMesh::ProjectPoints has been replaced with ANavigationData::BatchProjectPoints
	* More Info (three spaces indented from the previous line for wiki formatting)
* Improved stat id creation times. Now stat ids are created and registered once a run.
* Improved support for Clang C++ toolchain on Windows platform.
* INavAgentInterface::ShouldPostponePathUpdates has been removed. Use APawn::ShouldPostponePathUpdates or AController::ShouldPostponePathUpdates instead.
* Moved Base64 class from HTTP module for Core/Misc, to have better visibility from other modules (without any dependency to HTTP module).
* NonPIETransient renamed as NonPIEDuplicateTransient to better reflect that it's a variant of DuplicateTransient, not a variant of Transient.
	* If you use this specifier in a UPROPERTY, or its associated CPF_ flag, you should rename them appropriately.
* New experimental support for fast C++ dependency scanning (will be enabled in a future release).
* Passing relative .uproject paths to UnrealBuildTool no longer results in bad generated code.

* Refactored PathFollowing's MinAgentRadiusPct and MinAgentHeightPct use to be more clear and renamed MinAgentHeightPct to MinAgentHalfHeightPct. 
* Refactored Login() code to create a cleaner relationship between Login() and PostLogin()
	* InitNewPlayer()will register player, set name and other basic Login initialization, it shouldn't be overloaded by the game as it's still too early for game changes
	* Typically game code should start affecting the logged in player with PostLogin()
* The Windows specific FCOMPtr type was renamed to TComPtr
* Wide character modification functions ToUpper/ToLower/IsAlpha etc. are now implemented using native C++ functions.
* Change AutomationTool.CommandUtils.PushDir_NoExceptions to better mirror PushDir.
	* The code in PushDir_NoExceptions is now consistent with the inline source code documentation.
		* Previously, PushDir_NoExceptions did not have the ability to pop the final directory and return to the original working directory before anything was pushed.
* Fixed bug which prevented BuildPatchTool.exe from chunking empty directories in some situations
* Fixed potentially unsafe code in FWordWrapper::ProcessLine() loops with addition bounds checks.


#### Platforms
**Android**
* Updated AdBanner Blueprint nodes to reflect not just iOS support and renamed (removed experimental status).
* In preparation for x86 support in Android, the standard .apk no longer has -armv7 in the name (the .so inside as the -armv7 name).  

**iOS**
* iOS deployment from PC now requires the machine date/time to be reasonably accurate
	* Date/time checks are now in place to filter out expired mobile provisions and signing certificates, which will prevent various deployment issues, but they rely on the local machine time being correct.
* The project setting location for Metal support has moved - it's now under the main iOS Project Settings section. Please re-enable Metal support.

**Xbox One**
* The Live identity interface now triggers OnLoginStatusChanged instead of OnLoginChanged for sign-in changes.
	* OnLoginStatusChanged provides more information via its parameters.
	* See UShooterGameInstance for example usage.

**PlayStation 4**
* Upgraded to SDK 1.750!
* LCUE has been uplifted from the SDK into the Engine.This will allow future UE4 specific modification of the files. Support for standard CUE has been removed.

**HTML5**

**HTTP**
* Several improvements to HTTP Chunk Installer.
* Assets assigned to Chunks for use by IPlatformChunkInstall classes automatically include dependent assets when cooked with -manifests.
