## Major New Features

####Blueprints

* **Format Text Node** 
	* A new Format Text node has been added to Blueprints.	

		![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\FormatTextNode01.png)

	* The "Format" text can be a literal or connected to a pin. When used as a literal, it will auto-generate arguments for formatting. 

		![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\FormatTextNode02.png)

	* These arguments can be filled in as a literal or from a variable and the output Text will replace the arguments with whatever values are hooked to the pins.	 

		![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\FormatTextNode003.png)

	* When the "Format" pin is connected, the "Format" cannot be deciphered because it is variable. In this case, you can add pins yourself and name them after the possible arguments. In this way, you can setup the Format Text node to be ready for multiple possibilities. Whenever an argument matches at argument in the Format, it will utilize the provided information.	

		![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\FormatTextNode04.png)

	* Pin names can be changed, added, and removed from the Details Panel.

		![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\FormatTextNode05.png)

* **Node style changes and Append Array**
	* There is now an "Append Array" function which will add the contents of one array to the end of another.	

		![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\AppendArray.png)

	* Level actor references in Blueprints now have a new look, to better identify them:	

		![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\References.png)

	* Array function nodes have a new look as well!	

		![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\ArrayFunctionNodes.png)


####Editor and Tools

* **SoundCue Editor**
	* A palette of sound nodes has been added to the SoundCue editor!

		![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\SoundPalette.png)

* **Event Listing**
	* Graph sub-event listings have been added back to the "My Blueprint" tab, where you can focus, rename (for custom events), find, and delete event nodes.						

		![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\EventListing.png)

* **Documentation**
	* A handful of "big tooltips" have been added to help better explain certain nodes.

		![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\Documentation.png)

* **Scalability Interface**
	* There is a new user interface for scalability in the editor!	

		![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\scalability.png)

* **Actor Visibility in Scene Outliner**
	* It is now possible to quickly toggle actors' visibility from the scene outliner using the eye that appears beside each actor:
		
		![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\ActorVisibility.png)

* **Level Viewport**
	* In the Level Viewport, when you select a camera for example, you see a preview of what that camera sees in a Picture-in-Picture box in your current viewport. When you deselect the camera, the preview goes away.  

	* Added a button to those to the Actor Previews in the Level Viewport to pin them so they remain visible even if you select another object:

		![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\LevelViewport01.png)

	* As you can see, this is additive, so you will see any pinned previews plus any other preview actors you have selected. 

	* One potentially useful thing this allows you to do is to move actors in a camera shot while you preview what the camera sees, without using Matinee or multiple viewports:	

		![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\LevelViewport02.png)

#### Rendering
* **Sky Light and Precomputed Bent Normals**
	* There is now a Sky Light actor and a Sky Light Component for Blueprints.

	Here is an Ambient Cubemap with just SSAO.	  

	![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\Skylight01.png)	

	And here is a Sky Light with baked shadowing.	

	![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\Skylight02.png)	

	**Usability**	
	 
	* The Sky Light captures the distant parts of your level (everything further than Sky Distance Threshold) and applies that to the scene as a light.  
	  
	You can also manually specify a Cubemap to use.		

	![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\CubeMap.png)	
	
	* Previously, you had to pick an Ambient Cubemap for the sky's reflection while providing a different constant color for sky diffuse through Lightmass Environment Color. 
	 
	* The Sky Light is a full replacement for Environment Color and will replace the Ambient Cubemap in the future. 

	* Note however, that right now the Sky Light will only recapture the scene when you rebuild lighting or manually tell it to. 
	 
	**Baked Shadowing**		

	* The only version of the Sky Light supported right now is the one with Stationary Mobility, which means that it has baked shadowing from Lightmass.	

	* Once you place a sky light in your level, you have to rebuild lighting once to get the baked shadowing.  

	Lit by Sky Light only.	

	![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\Skylight05.png)

* **New Experimental Feature: DBuffer Deferred Decals**
	* Deferred decals now work with baked/lightmass lighting.	 
	That has a cost - not all projects make use of baked lighting or need proper decals so this can be enabled as a project setting and you need to change the decal blend mode.	

		![](Support\Builds\ReleaseNotes\2014\January\DBufferDeferredDecals01.png)	

	Right: baked lighting with a classic decal (no DBuffer) has broken lighting (should look like the left one).
	* How to activate the feature:
		* To try DBuffer locally, put this into BaseEngine.ini under [SystemSettings]
		* r.EarlyZPassMovable=1
		* r.EarlyZPass=2
		* r.DBuffer=1
		* Use new DBuffer decal blend mode
	* Similar changes can be made in the project settings in case you want that use that feature in your project.


## New Additions 

#### Editor and Tools

#### Blueprints
* Added "Blueprints.Find Timelines On Server" editor automation test, to identify TimelineComponents that are hooked up in Blueprints and will run on dedicated servers (Timelines can tick and can impact performance).
	* This test walks backwards up the execution chain to find which Timelines can possibly be executed by non-cosmetic (server) events and flags those as errors in the log.
	* A macro has been added to StandardMacros ("Can Execute Cosmetic Events") which can be used to conditionally avoid executing Timelines on servers. The automation test checks for this macro explicitly.
* Added GetStreamingLevel BP node. Returns ULevelStreamingKismet object which allows better control over level streaming in blueprints.
* Icons denoting a components mobility are now displayed alongside components in the blueprint component list-view.
* Event navigation added back to the "My Blueprints" tab (events implemented in a graph are now listed in the tree).

* Can now diff arbitrary blueprints against each other, as well as arbitrary revisions.
* Added an "Append Array" function to Blueprints.
* Added a "Format Text" node to Blueprints.
* Text variables can be handled as literals.
* Various Text to Number nodes made available in Blueprints.

#### Rendering
* A new console command 'scalability' has been added which allows engine settings to be controlled simply in order to balance performance and quality. Type 'scalability' in the console to see full documentation on its usage.
* A new UI has been added under "View->Engine Scalability Settings". This gives access to the same functionality that the "scalability" console command offers.
* Added scale factors for static and skeletal mesh LOD calculations. (r.SkeletalMeshLODRadiusScale and r.StaticMeshLODDistanceScale).
* Added Post processing options to 2D scene capture component.
* New Blueprint function on static meshes to toggle bRenderCustomDepth property called SetRenderCustomDepth();
* New checkbox in collision particle module to enable collision checks with the source actor of the effect. Useful when creating blueprints with meshes and particles that you want to interact.
* New material checkbox to toggle use of vertex fogging for translucent surfaces.
* **Sky Light Feature**
	* Provides a unified representation of sky light, between diffuse and specular and what you see directly
	* Sky light component will automatically capture the distant geometry and apply it to the scene as lighting
	* Lightmass bakes out bent normal ambient occlusion, which provides directional shadowing
	* This feature is new and not fully functional yet, for example no character shadows, doesn't apply to translucency, etc.
* Particle light modules can opt-in to affecting translucency
* Material Ambient Occlusion output is applied to all indirect lighting, which is useful for volumetric particles
* **Precomputed Visibility Improvements**
	* New cell placement heuristic that covers potential play areas much more thoroughly, but with increased build times
	* Various optimizations to build times
	* Precomputed Visibility is now much more reliable, which is important for mobile
* **Customized UVs** 
	* Allows moving expensive operations to the vertex shader which are interpolated to the pixel shader material inputs.
	* [Customized UVs UDN Page](https://udn.unrealengine.com/docs/ue4/INT/Engine/Rendering/Materials/CustomizedUVs/index.html)
* **Adaptive sampling Lightmass GI solver**
	* Provides higher quality in worse case situations (bright light coming in tiny window) for the same build time.
	* New World Settings lightmass property: IndirectLightingQuality which can be used to increase solver quality for maps that need it.
* Added DBuffer deferred decals (experimental feature, costs extra 10bytes per pixel GPU memory, allows decals with lightmaps, supports color,normal,roughness, separate opacity)  enable from ini: r.EarlyZPassMovable=1   r.EarlyZPass=2  r.DBuffer=1

#### Gameplay and Framework
* LogVisualizer improvements: log category filtering.
* CharacterMovementComponents will apply a force to objects the pawn stands on and will generate a constant repulsion force on objects it overlap if PlayerPhysics is enabled.
* Convex hull support in Physical Asset Tool (PhAT).
* Added a way to pass custom filters to navigation queries.
* Bound GameplayDebuggingComponent with LogVisualizer so that when an AI is clicked in simulation mode and LogVisualizer is present, then LogVisualizer will switch over to show log of selected AI.
* ReferenceViewer is no longer in EpicLabs, it is now part of the main editor.
	* Existing reference tools have been moved into the right click menu for nodes in the reference viewer.
	* Added support for depth and breadth limiting for more sane graphs. Also added history.
* Added CameraBlockingVolume. This simple volume just blocks the ECC_Camera collision channel. 
* Added KillZVolume. This simple volume kills pawns that touch it.
* MemReport command now outputs a comprehensive memory report to Saved/Profiling/MemReports. It works similarly to how memleakcheck worked in UE3. The commands it runs can be modified in ini files.
* **ForceFeedback**
	* ForceFeedbackEffect asset can be created in content browser.  An effect contains an array of entries containing a curve and booleans indicating which servos are affected by this curve.
	* Playing/Stopping an effect is done via function calls on the PlayerController.
* **SoundGroups**
	* A SoundWave can be assigned to a SoundGroup.  The sound group allows sounds to be have different decompression properties.  In the future this will also be used for flagging sounds that should be streamed.
	* Custom game SoundGroups can be specified somewhat similarly to custom Collision Profiles.
* Reworking of AnimNotify UI. Notifies now clamp to tracks making them easier to drag/drop and will automatically pan a zoomed track display
* Refactor of AnimNotifies so that they can be set at previously disallowed times (0, Sequence Length, section times).
* Added skeleton retargeting for animations to the content browser (automatically triggered when opening an asset with a NULL skeleton)
* Added importing of lods for morph targets.
* Added a UV display to Persona.
* Added Vertex  Normal, Tangent and Binormal views to Persona.
* **Voice**
	* First pass at a new voice capture interface.
		* DirectSound voice capture implementation (125ms notifications).
		* Missing proper enumeration/detection of microphone plug/unplug (leave plugged in at launch for now).
	* First pass at a new voice codec interface (opus 1.0.3, soon to be 1.1).
	* Stats added for voice codec timings.
* **SKELETALMESH** 
	* Simplygon bone reduction support. 
	* Remove selected bones from LODs before applying simplygon mesh reduction.


#### Core
* Added hierarchical stats display ( 'stat groupname+', for more information use 'stat' command ).
	* Added thread safe FMemStack.
* The UnrealHeaderTool manifest (the 'response file' used to execute UHT) is now written to the Intermediate folder so that it can be used to diagnose build errors or debug UHT.
	* The manifest is now also in JSON format, making it easier for humans to read and computers to parse.
* Hot reload conflicts are written next to generated header file (as a .generated.h.conflict file) to help diagnose changes.
* UnrealHeaderTool now supports files with UTF-8 BOMs.
* NonPIETransient property specifier added to allow a property to be serialized only when it is being duplicated for Play-In-Editor(PIE).
* Added -pakdir=dir command line param to be able to specify additional pak file locations.
* Zero engine version support - the engine will now allow loading packages saved with 0 engine version (local builds).
* Support for NULL (None) active class redirects.
* Reference elimination is now supported in AddReferencedObjects.
* Added the ability to sign pak files with asymetrical key.

#### Platforms
* Added controller vibration (currently only supported on PS4).
* Added high level "Game DVR" control (currently only support on PS4).
* Added safe zone support in Slate (put widgets inside an SSafeZone widget, see ShooterGameLoadingScreen for an example, or the top of SSafeZone.h) (currently only PS4 specifies a safe zone).
* **Mac**
	* Implemented C++ symbol loading for the Editor on Mac OS X.
	* Implemented a better method for opening files in Xcode from within the Editor so new code files are opened within the Xcode project.

#### Audio
* Audio components can have integer parameters.
* Switch node for sound cues.
* Multiway branching can be achieved when used with integer parameters on audio components.

#### Animation
* Added ability to mute audio to the Viewport menu when editing an animation sequence.

#### Networking
* Ability to override active status of lifetime replicated properties.
	* Use DOREPLIFETIME_ACTIVE_OVERRIDE during AActor::PreReplication.     
* Lots of network performance enhancements.
* Sharing the replication work across connections is on by default (performance improvement).
* Simplification of FNetworkGUID ack logic (will reduce log spam under load when loading levels).

* The option to auto recompile blueprints on PIE is now controllable from Editor Preferences. 
	* Any custom *.ini files referencing Kismet.AutoRecompileOnPIE should be changed to use /Script/UnrealEd.LevelEditorPlayInSettings.AutoRecompileBlueprints in the relevant EditorUserSettings ini instead.
* ALevelGridVolume actor was removed.
* GetOverlappingActors no longer returns the actor the call is made on.
* Changed Position & Translation to Location in Blueprint functions; impacts several C++ functions:
	* UPrimitiveComponent::AddImpulseAtPosition() becomes UPrimitiveComponent::AddImpulseAtLocation()
	* UPrimitiveComponent::AddForceAtPosition() becomes UPrimitiveComponent::AddForceAtLocation()
	* UMovementComponent::ConstrainPositionToPlane() becomes UMovementComponent::ConstrainLocationToPlane()

#### Rendering
* An error in the calculation of text render actor vertical alignment transforms has been fixed. This may potentially result in some text being incorrectly position, which will need manually correcting.
* **Engine Scalability**
	* Added GetRenderingDetailMode to Kismet.
	* Added GPUIndex to HardwareSurvey.
	* More polish on engine scalability feature.
	* Added ECVF_Scalability to document if a cvar can be used as scalability option.
	* Added Blueprint GetRenderingMaterialQualityLevel, added help and clamped another one.
	* Added r.CompileShadersForDevelopment to allow for faster shipping build when set to 0 (needs to be manually activated, unfinished feature).
	* Added MaterialQualityLevel to scaleability settings - JonL suggested 0/1/1/1, could have been 0/0/1/1 - depending on content.
	* Optimized very low spec rendering cost for Fortnite, disables UI Blur background.
	* r.earlyzpass now renders all non moving objects if in mode 2 (masked or small on screen).
	* Added PF_R8G8 UNORM texture format.
* **Post Processing**
	* Clamped minimal speed for eye adaptation to not have people disabling eyeadaptation through this parameter.
	* Reenabled FastBloomThreshold as this was more noticable there.
	* Removed toe factor - isn't used in new tonemapper anyway - old tonemapper doesn't exist any more.
	* Added debug export to the graph for much nicer readble graphs (using yWorks) r.CompositionGraphDebug exports the files to the screenshots folder.
	* Reenabled native fullscreen for video options.
	* Experimental feature work: made screenspace subsurface scattering using alpha scene color alpha channel to separate out specular, very minor cost for most passes and if using a 32bit format we don't have the enabled. We intend to use enable ScreenSpace subsurface scattering and that is needed for high quality, see r.SSSSS 150 on subsurface material with a specular.
	* Typed console variables vars for better performance when reading cvars (main and render thread).
	* Improved interface to DrawDenormalizedQuad(), now renamed to DrawRectangle(), by default using classic quad, can be a triangle.
	* Allow visualization of EarlyZPass content using "vis SceneDepth@0"

#### Blueprints
* Nested blueprint components may have their mobility altered if their parent is more mobile than they are.
	* We no longer allow sub-components to be flagged with less mobility than their parent.
* Blueprint game-components will be unnested (or swapped, if the root) if they were previously nested under an editor-only component.
	* We no longer allow game-components to be nested under editor-only ones.

#### Gameplay and Framework
* Switched navigation system's API from using const FNavigationQueryFilter* to TSharedPtr`<const FNavigationQueryFilter>`
* InputComponent  bindings made in native code now use UObject binding instead of dynamic binding.
	* BIND_AXIS and BIND_ACTION should no longer be used and, while they remain currently for ease of conversion, they will be removed in the future.
	* Instead BindAxis and BindAction functions on InputComponent should be used.  BindKey and BindTouch have also been added.
* MinCompressedDurationGame/Editor has been removed.  See new feature SoundGroups for details on replacement.

#### Core
* Classes saved in blueprints are now converted to notplaceable if they inherit a notplaceable base.
	* Previously it would assert.
* TIndirectArray no longer inherits TArray.
	* Any code which does TIndirectArray->TArray casts will now fail.
	* Code which uses non-exposed TArray functions will need changing, e.g. GetData() should now be GetTypedArray().
* Some pathnames have been shortened to try and reduce MAX_PATH overflows.
	* This may affect navigation or batch files which expect files to be in particular places.
	* Notably, Intermediate/BuildData/Include is now Intermediate/Build/Inc.
* TWeakObjectPtr now static asserts that it is being instantiated with a UObject-derived type.
	* This will require that a full class definition wherever TWeakObjectPtrs are constructed, as the compiler won't just assume that your type is a UObject any more.
* begin() and end() are no longer container methods.
	* These functions were added purely for ranged-for support; they were not intended to be used in user code.  Ranged-for will still work as it uses an alternative system.
	* Any code using .begin() or .end() on UE containers should be converted to use ranged-for or the older CreateIterator-style of iteration.
* UnrealHeaderTool will now throw an error when it encounters a default argument that it can't parse.	
	* Code like this, for example, will need to be modified to use NULL:
	* `UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category="SomeCategory")`
	* `void Func(UObject* Obj = nullptr)`
	* `{`
	* `}`
* Eliminated bCompileMonolithicBinary global variable which was sometimes used by game targets 
	* Instead, override ShouldCompileMonolithic() in your program's TargetRules file (MyGame.Target.cs).
	* You can still use command-line arguments to override this if needed (-modular, -monolithic, or MONOLITHIC_BUILD=1).
* Removed "Fast Iteration Mode" from Unreal Build Tool (incomplete feature).
* Default minimum Windows API (WINVER) was bumped to 0x600 (Windows Vista or higher).
	* If you want to target Windows XP, set UEBuildWindows.SupportWindowsXP=_true_.
	* When targeting Windows XP, we use WINVER 0x502 (XP SP3).
	* Windows XP support is a work-in-progress, but we are committed to supporting it in a future build.

#### Platforms
* Putting all device profiles back in the editor. 
* Removed the DeviceProfiles.ini and converted this to use the same config hierarchy as other engine config files. Base->Default->Saved
* Updated the Texture Content Streaming to use allow usage of CVar where we would otherwise have specified that we use a config option.
* Putting back this property.
* Removed Device Profile redundant properties. 
* Updated the device profile setup to allow CVars to be initialized eary and removed Device Profile Blueprints, This has resulted in the creation of device profile plugins which run selection logic.  
* Updated save to defaults, so that array writes are using correct syntax. 
* Updated the settings editor to save after importing.
* **iOS**
	* Virtual joysticks have changed for touchscreen devices. They now use an asset. If you want to disable the joysticks, override the InitialTouchInterface ini setting in the [MobileSlateUI] section of Engine.ini
	* Unreal Launch Daemon has been fixed to work with Messaging to allow for device discovery and deploying/launching from UFE/UAT.
* **Unreal Frontend**
	* Unreal Frontend (UFE) can now utilize plugins.
	* Update to messaging to allow for static ips.
		* To see a device or session on a subnet different than the PC, do the following (these steps are also needed to see the PS4):
			* Run UFE once to generate the Engine/Programs/UnrealFrontend/Saved/Config/Windows/Engine.ini
			* Edit Engine.ini and add to the [/Script/UdpMessaging.UdpMessagingSettings]
			* StaticEndpoints=<ip of device>:6666
			* To add more than one device, add the line multiple times.
			* In the case of iOS, push Unreal Launch Daemon to the device and run it, add the static ip address as above, and it will now see the device.
			* In the case of PS4, just add the ip address as above and it will see sessions on the kit.
			* This hasn't been tested with XB1, but it should work.
	* Added ability to copy and save the launcher log.
	* Addition of Quick Launch to UFE.
		* Quick Launch will start a cook on the fly server, deploy, and launch the project on the selected device.
		* If -development is specified on the UFE command-line, Quick Launch will also build the project before launch.
	
#### Networking
* Lifetime properties are the only supported path now, this will most likely require code changes.
* GetReplicationList has been replaced by GetLifetimeReplicatedProps.
	* GetLifetimeReplicatedProps is only called once now.
* DOREPLIFETIME to register non conditional properties.
* DOREPLIFETIME_CONDITION to register properties with conditions.
* Possible conditions:
	* COND_None					- This property has no condition, and will send anytime it changes.
	* COND_InitialOnly			- This property will only attempt to send on the initial bunch.
	* COND_OwnerOnly			- This property will only send to the actor's owner.
	* COND_SkipOwner			- This property send to every connection EXCEPT the owner.
	* COND_SimulatedOnly		- This property will only send to simulated actors.
	* COND_AutonomousOnly		- This property will only send to autonomous actors.
	* COND_SimulatedOrPhysics	- This property will send to simulated OR bRepPhysics actors.
	* COND_InitialOrOwner		- This property will send on the initial packet, or to the actors owner.
	* COND_Custom				- This property has no particular condition, but wants the ability to toggle on/off via DOREPLIFETIME_ACTIVE_OVERRIDE.


## Future Additions and Ongoing Efforts

#### Editor and Tools
* It is no longer necessary to hold CTRL to move curve control points in matinee.
* There is now a "cancel" button on the "Compiling C++ Code" notification to allow cancellation of the current build.

	* It already does this when Play-In-Editor(PIE) starts.
	* Closing stops accidental editing of actors in the wrong world when Play-In-Editor(PIE) starts/ends.
* Levels Browser functionality was merged into World Browser. Levels Browser will be removed eventually.
* Added ability for ULevelStreamingKismet to set loaded and visible flags at game startup (InitiallyLoaded, InitiallyVisible).
