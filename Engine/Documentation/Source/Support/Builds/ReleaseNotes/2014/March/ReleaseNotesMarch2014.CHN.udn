## Important information

* The March QA build has not been as well aligned as we would like. We have been putting consoles through cert, and have not been able to line up the console fixes with the public release and with the QA build. 

	This has caused the march QA build to be delayed, and the content in **UE4-Releases/4.0/** to not contain working consoles right now. The consoles are currently in **//depot/UE4-QA-Unstable/** ( *which was branched from Releases* ) and we are working to back port the fixes from certification into that branch that we can safely do.   We should be branching imminently to **//depot/UE4-QA/** however, for those doing console games, the April QA should have at least one console's cert build in there, and the May QA should have both.

## Major New Features

#### Blueprints

* **Blueprint Macro Debugging**

	* Support has been added for Blueprint macro debugging!

	* For example, if you set a breakpoint on a macro instance node in your Blueprint event graph, execution will now break on the first executable node inside of the macro graph when you Play-in-Editor/Simulate-in-Editor. You should also now be able to single-step, set breakpoints in and see variable pin values directly inside of a macro graph while debugging Blueprint objects.

		_Example: If you set a breakpoint on a "Gate" node:_	
		
		![](MacroDebugging01.png)	
		
		_Execution will break on the sequence node attached to the "Enter" output inside of the "Gate" macro graph. If you then set a breakpoint on the "Branch" node inside of the macro and then click "Resume"..._	
		
		![](MacroDebugging02.png)	
		
		_...execution will next break at that point:_			
		
		![](MacroDebugging03.png)	
		
		_You should also be able to hover over pins to see current variable values:_	
		
		![](MacroDebugging04.png)

* **Pin Icons in Blueprints**

	* Recently, the default BP pin icons were changed to a new, teardrop style by default in the editor.  

		If you prefer the old, original style, you can change your Editor Settings to use the original pins:
		
		![](PinIcons.png)(w:720)

#### Editor and Tools 

* **Physical Asset Tool (PhAT)**

	* Improvements have been made to the physical asset editor!
		
		![](PhysicalAssetTool.png)

	* Selected Simulation allows you to simulate the area of interest while keeping the rest of the body fixed.
	* Multiselect is now supported for easily tuning multiple bodies and constraints.
	* You can use hotkeys 1,2,3,4 to toggle Swing1, Swing2, Twist and cycle to quickly visualize constraint limits.
	* No Gravity will simulate without gravity. This is really useful for catching mistakes like collision between adjacent bodies or bad constraints.

* **Color Picker Usability Improvements**

	* Default view
		* Saturation and value sliders.
		* Theme bar will show a help message when empty.
		* Small separators between color preview blocks.
		* Color picker now always picks the color that is visible on the screen, regardless of sRGB preview toggle.
			
			![](ColorPicker01.png)

	* Advanced settings view
		* R, G, B channels now also have preview gradients like H, S, V.
		* Hex input/outfield.
		* A can now be larger than 1.0 (for material editor).
		* Preview gradients are now slightly thicker for better visibility.
		* Sliders are now wider for more mouse precision.
		* Slider numeric inputs now 3 instead of 2 digit precision to allow for correct Hex translation.
			
			![](ColorPicker02.png)

	* Quick Pick Mode
		* The little color wheel button next to the pipette toggles color wheel and quick pick.

			_Currently, right-clicking the wheel works, too._

		* Quick pick spectrum for when you need to experiment with light and dark colors quickly.

			_The horizontal center line represents Hues at 1.0 value and 1.0 saturation._

			_Colors towards the top are saturated against white._

			_Colors towards the bottom are lit against black._		
			
			![](ColorPicker03.png)

* **Developer Folder Disabled by Default**

	* The Engine folder is now also disabled by default! 

		* Its visibility can be toggled from the View Options.	 
			
			![](DeveloperFolder.png)

* **Play-In-Editor(PIE) and Launch Changes**

	* PIE changes:
		* No longer has menu entries for all the 'Current Camera / Default Player Start' combination.
			* Current Camera / Default Player Start is now a global toggle at the bottom.
			* You then simply click on any of the four entries on top to start PIE.
		* There's a new option 'Mobile Preview' which launches a standalone game with OpenGL ES emulation.
		* The big 'Play' button will still remember the last choice.
		* Menu entries and tooltips are hopefully easier to read/understand now.	
			
			![](PIE01.png)

	* Launch changes:
		* Devices are now broken out per platform.
		* A slew of problems with the listing of available devices have been fixed.
		* The big 'Launch' button in the toolbar will still remember your last choice.
		* The default choice for the 'Launch' button is now your local PC.

* **Snap Now Defaults to Decimal Intervals**

	* We have now defaulted our snap sizes to decimal intervals! 

		1 unreal unit  = 1 centimeter.

	* These are the new snap sizes:		
		
		![](DecimalIntervals01.png)

	* You can change back to snap settings back to powers of 2 for your game in the preferences Viewports->Grid Snapping:
		
		![](DecimalIntervals02.png)

* **Collision Setting**

	* You can now Set up and modify Collision Settings!

		You can add new channels for your project, a new profile or customize existing ones.

	* The setting can be found under Edit->Project Settings->Engine->Collision:
		
		![](CollisionSetting.png)

* **Input Mapping Bindings Panel**

	* There is a new Input Mapping Binding Panel!

		This can be found under Edit -> Project Settings -> Input.

	* There are three separate sections within the Input panel :

		_Axis Config_	
		
		![](AxisConfig.png)

		_Action Mappings_		
		
		![](ActionMappings.png)

		_Axis Mappings_		
		
		![](AxisMappings.png)

	* There are two buttons for adding action and axis mappings.
		
		The top one will create a new mapping with no name set but the one by the name of the mapping itself will add another one with the same name to that group.

* **Placement/Content Browser & Editor Modes**

	* The Placement Browser has been revived with a brand new look.  
	
		In the new placement browser you'll find quick access to Lights, Triggers, Volumes and all Classes, you can even access a lengthy list of your recently placed assets.

	* The Editor Modes have all been reunited in the Tools tab.		
		
		![](PlacementBroswer01.png)

	* Additionally, the Content Browser has received a new look as well. 
		
		![](PlacementBroswer02.png)

* **Details Panel Header Slimming, Open C++ Files**

	* The two details header rows have now been compressed down to one simple row.  The icon tool tip now shows the class name (like Scene Outliner.)   

	* For actors that have C++ code, you can click on the header file hyperlink to open the code (only shows up if you have VS or Xcode installed.)
		
		![](DetailsPanel01.png)

	* Previously the actor class name was a hyperlink that took you to the Blueprint editor.  Now there is a separate button for that.
		
		![](DetailsPanel02.png)

	* We have also added C++ file access to the viewport right click menu (if you have a compiler installed).  

		Of course, you can also double-click on click on classes in Class Viewer.		
		
		![](DetailsPanel03.png)

* **New Tool for Programmers: Messaging Debugger**

	* There is a new tool called the Messaging Debugger, which is a visual debugging tool for the messaging system in UE4, aka. Unreal Message Bus (UMB). 

		Applications that utilize the messaging system can be quite difficult to debug due to the highly asynchronous nature of a messaging system. 

	* At this point the Messaging Debugger still has to be considered 'experimental � use at your own risk' and must be explicitly activated in the Editor Preferences:		
		
		![](MessagingDebugger1.png) ![](MessagingDebugger2.png)

#### Rendering

* **Glossy Screen Space Reflections**

	* Screen Space Reflections supporting material roughness has been added and is enabled by default!
		
		If you do not want any screen space reflection, you can fade/disable the feature in the Post Process Settings. 
		Some materials might need a minor tweak but those would have been appeared wrong with other reflections anyway. 
		Now we have it consistent with Image Based Lighting and normal (analytical) light sources.

	* Example decal with varying roughness (very small viewport so you can see the grain/noise):
		
		![](Glossy.png)

* **Preview Shadows Indicator**

	* We now have a preview shadow indicator in the form of text that shows up in shadows.  

		_Built � distance field shadow maps_	
		
		![](PreviewShadows01.png)

		_Unbuilt - using preview shadows with indicator_
		
		![](PreviewShadows02.png)

	* There is a show flag under 'Visualize' which can be used to disable it.  
		
		To tweak the light function material used to project the text, it's Material'/Engine/EditorMaterials/PreviewShadowIndicatorMaterial.PreviewShadowIndicatorMaterial'

#### Animation

* **Non-Uniform Scale Animation**

	* We now support non-uniform scale animations. No option is required. When import animation, if scale exists, it will import. 

		For the memory concern, we don't save scale for all animations. We only saves it if it has scale that isn't 1. 

	* Example videos of the animations.

* Lowered memory usage during navmesh rebuild, only a few generators will receive collision data at the same time.
* Increased maximum navmesh tile dimension to 65536 voxels (was: 256).
* Increased maximum number of navmesh polys and tiles by switching to 64bit poly address.
* New region partitioning for navmesh generation: ChunkyMonotone
	* Divides tile into rectangular chunks (default: 2x2) and runs monotone partitioning on them.
	* Noticeably faster than default mode (watershed)
	* Chunk split protects from creating long, thin polys, but generates slightly more polys than other methods.
	* Partitioning method selection moved to Advanced display of RecastNavMesh's Generation category.
* Added default navigation area for dynamic obstacles (similar to default walkable), which can be overridden by game specific settings.
* Added EQS debug drawing to GameplayDebuggingComponent's display.
* GameplayDebuggingComponent's drawing is using its own show flag now: GameplayDebugging.
* Implemented EQSTestingPawn, a tool to test EQS queries in the editor's viewport.
* Defined FAISystem::InvalidLocation to be used as value for "not-set" or "cleared" FVectors used with AI.
* Added a way to time-slice single EQS test.
* Added new super cool EQS generator to generate items on a circle around indicated context.

* In a blendspace anim notifies can now be limited to the highest weighted animation; or disabled altogether.

#### Core
* Added Simplygon ProxyLOD integration, supports merging of static mesh components and landscapes (hidden under Experimental->Actor Merging).
* Added actor merging utility with grouping by materials (hidden under Experimental->Actor Merging).
* Dedicated servers can now have their own ini files (DedicatedServer*.ini) stored in the same directory as Default*.ini
* UBT: Added Type and IsCooked properties to TargetInfo class: this way build rules can conditionally configure modules when building binaries for cooked targets. 
* Added the ability to create multiple pak file builds based on asset registry data and game callbacks (useful for chunking game downloads).
* nullptr and 0 are now accepted as default arguments for pointers in BlueprintCallableFunctions.
* Interface UFunctions are now found via field iteration.
* There's a new TFieldRange class that can be used in the same way as TFieldIterator, but for use in ranged-for constructs, e.g. for (`UFunction* Func : TFieldRange<UFunction>(Class)`).
* And there's a new TObjectRange which works equivalently for TObjectIterator.
* TMaps and TMultiMap can now be added to (or emplaced with) a single key argument, e.g. Map.Add(Key);, and the mapped value will be default-constructed.
* Delegates now have AddUniqueDynamic and IsAlreadyBound functions to aid code which may bind the same object/function multiple times.
* Non-ANSI characters are now handled correctly by UnrealHeaderTool (e.g. comments parsed for tooltips, DisplayName specifiers etc.).
* Enabled BinnedMalloc in non-editor Win64 builds. Added support for aligned allocations up to the page size of the platform being run on.

#### Platforms
* **Mac**
	* Modify & rename iOSMoviePlayer plugin to compile & link on Mac OS X which also uses the same AVFoundation API for movie playback (already used in AVIWriter).
	* Make Mac windows render with drop shadows & rounded corners when required, plus make the close/minimize/restore buttons highlight as they should in OS X.
	* Initial implementation of crash reporting for Mac OS X using the new C++ crash reporter, generating similar reports as the Linux version.
	* Enable the new CrashReportClient & disable all old error reporting on OS X.
	* Add a suppressible dialog to warn users to update when they aren't running the latest version of Mac OS X.
	* Support TCHAR in LLDB.
* **Android**
	* Show the supported texture formats in the four-finger-tap dialog.
	* Added support for r.MobileContentScaleFactor on Android (1.0 means 1280x720, but with proper aspect ratio), clamped to native resolution.
	* Android audio support has been added using ogg.

#### Animation
* Added different options for locking root bone while extracting root motion. Changed default from first frame of animation to ref pose.
* Optimization: Enabled CachedLocalBounds optimization for SkeletalMeshes to all.		
* **ANIMATION NEEDS RESAVE**
	* We added a GUID to Skeleton assets, so that animations can track the version. We recommend you resave all animations. Otherwise, animations will be compressed at load time.
* Non-uniform scaled animation support: Only used when scaling is applied (e.g not equal to 1,1,1).
	* If you are having an issue with importing scale, enable "Preserve Local Transform."
	* Please note that we don't support skew/shearing, so that information will be eliminated and produce different result than source data.


## Upgrade Notes

#### Editor and Tools
* Selected Actors Delta Transform for context menu.
* Show Uncached static Lighting build info in SceneOutliner.
* Added Console Command to dump visible actors ("DumpVisibleActors").
* Atmospheric fog: Added Blueprint access for Precompute variables (only valid for editor).
* Decimal snap grid is now enabled by default and the snap size is now 10 cm.  You will need to enable the power of two snap grid in the viewport settings to revert to the old behavior.
* Engine content has been disabled by default in the content browser.  You can enable this again in the content browsers view settings.
* VirtualJoystick: Inherits values from UTouchInterface.
	* Added bPreventRecenter, which prevents Joystick re-centering.
	* Prevent moving outside of screen, clamp ThumbPosition to be inside screen.
	* Added Activation Delay.
	* Added InputScale to control each Joystick's speed.
* Default ProjectileMovementComponent Velocity to (1,0,0) to make it a bit simpler to use.
* Remove GameModeForPIE. 
* Created SEnableBox, which lies to the contained widget about whether the parent hierarchy is enabled or not.
* Created an external image reference widget, which internally handles checkout/add/etc...
* Added the ability for asset type actions to provide a user description of the asset, showing up in a separate section of the tooltip.
* Level streaming refactoring to fix Launch and Play in new process for maps with streaming levels.
* Changed graph panel grid rendering method to keep sharpness at all zoom levels and show origin lines in a third color.

#### Rendering
* Changed SSAO defaults to be more subtle.
* Light properties cleanup. Major changes: point / spot lights use inverse squared falloff by default, Brightness changed to Intensity with new defaults per light type, Radius renamed to AttenuationRadius.
* To prepare for future shader optimisations, it is now a requirement to bind shaders to the global state BEFORE setting any parameters. Trying to set parameters on a shader which isn't currently bound will produce and ensure.
* Almost all settings have been removed from SystemSettings, and replaced with equivalent console variables. This includes system resolution (GSystemSettings.ResX/ResY) which are now accessible from code via GSystemResolution.ResX and GSystemResolution.ResY. A new console variable (r.setres) has also been added to replace the old "setres" command.
* The default near clipping plane has been set to 10cm. This may cause z-fighting if your game uses very long view distances. See r.SetNearClipPlane.
* Made PostprocessAmbient purely additive, not occluded by environment reflections or other things (other than SSAO), now it's meant to make an more interesting ambient (content might need to retweaked) not a infinitly far away skybox texture.
* Changed TextRender default material to be opaque (TemporalAA quality improvements now make this the better option).
* Consoles now use less memory when using ScreenPercentage. In case the game wants to dynamically change it over multiple frames this is not the right method. If needed we can use the cvars settings and make it a platform/game property.
* Usability change of showflags: game and editor showflag state now allows proper toggle (2 states are stored and toggled).
* Allow TemporalAA in editor by default (minor flickering with editor primitives is expected).
* Split ScalabilitySetting persistence into game and editor (different ini files). This allows early loading of the settings (even game isn't there yet) and avoid reinit of subsystems.

#### Gameplay and Framework
* Oculus integration has been updated with improvements to latency, and support for positional tracking devices. Note:  LibOVR SDK for positional tracking must be procured from Oculus in order to use the functionality
* Components Array removal
	* The components array has been removed, it is no longer necessary to add newly created components to any array. If you do not wish a created component to be registered set bAutoRegister to false.  Access to the components array is via the AActor::GetComponents function.  Unless a component is created independently of an Actor, the component must have a direct outer of the Actor. In general, you cannot have components that are subobjects of a non-actor. 
* Input binding changes
	* Key bindings are now done by name instead of enum.  A new struct FKey encapsulates the name and provides a number of helper functions. It is encouraged to use these helper functions for things such as IsGamePadKey, however, the EKeys::IsGamepadKey functions are still defined to make migration easier.
	* EKeys enum has been eliminated.  Places that used EKeys::Type or EKey will generally need to be changed to FKey
	* All EKeys enum entries (e.g. EKeys::MouseX) have been translated in to static const members of an EKeys struct so most usages of key names will still work, however, because it is a struct you can no longer switch on a Key's value.
	* Many Input settings have been moved out of Engine.PlayerInput and in to Engine.InputSettings. Of most significant note: AxisConfig, ActionMappings, and AxisMappings.
* WorldFromContextGetter has been removed.  All UObjects can now implement a virtual GetWorld() function instead.
* APlayerCamera has been renamed APlayerCameraManager.
* AxisMappings MoveForward, MoveRight, MoveUp, Lookup, and Turn and ActionMapping PushToTalk have been removed from BaseInput.ini.  They must be supplied in the DefaultInput.ini for your specific game if required.
* SoundNodeGroupControl no longer considers distance.  Instead it simply ensures that the maximum number of sounds for each 'bucket' is playing before falling to the next 'bucket'.
* SoundNode NotifyFinished hooks have been restructured.  It is now possible for multiple nodes to request notification of the wave instance completing.
* UMETA is now consistent with other markup macros, in particular it uses comma instead of pipe as delimeter.
* Visual Studio 2013 is now used by default
	* Remember that your developers (and users of packaged builds) will need the Visual C++ 2013 redist installed.
	* You can still use Visual Studio 2012 if you need to (see below for more info, and CL # 1989640).
	* Certain platforms have debugging add-ins that do not work with the new IDE yet.  
		* We detect these platforms and force the project file format to 2012 automatically.
		* You can always override behavior by passing '-2012' or '-2013' on the GenerateProjectFiles command line.
	* Other special use cases:
		* If you want to use VS 2012 for everything (because you don't have VS 2013 yet), locally modify WindowsPlatform.Compiler in UEBuildWindows.cs.
		* If you want to keep using VS 2012 IDE but compile with VS 2013, make sure you have VS 2013 installed and pass '-2012' to GenerateProjectFiles.
		* If you want to use the VS 2013 IDE but compile with VS 2012, you can set WindowsPlatform.Compiler to 2012, but pass '-2013' to GenerateProjectFiles.
* Visual Studio 2013 Express for Windows Desktop is now fully supported!
* DirectX SDK prerequisites are now included along with the source!
	You no longer need to have the DirectX SDK installed on your PC to build the engine.
* Visual Studio and Xcode project file changes
	* Project files now generate for all platforms by default; Removed "AllPlatforms" .bat file.
		* You can pass "-CurrentPlatform" to get the old behavior if you want.
	* Project files: 'Shipping' configuration is now included by default.
		* You can pass "-NoShippingConfigs" to omit Shipping config (smaller/faster project files).
* Debug builds no longer use the Debug CRT (or Debug third party libraries) by default
	* Added new UnrealBuildTool option:  bDebugBuildsActuallyUseDebugCRT  (BuildConfiguration.cs)
	* bDebugBuildsActuallyUseDebugCRT: This is true if we should compile Debug builds using Debug CRT libs and Debug third party dependencies.  Otherwise, we'll actually compile against the Release CRT but leave optimizations turned off, so that it is still easy to debug.  
	* If you enable this setting, actual Debug versions of third party static libraries will be needed when compiling in Debug.
* Removed 'Shipping' PhysX binaries and libraries
	* We now link with PROFILE versions in all configurations by default.
* Removed default Steam file from binaries (steam_appid.txt)
	* You should create your own steam_appid.txt for your game project with a unique Steamworks ID for your project.
* Disable Link-Time-Code-Generation (LTCG) by default, even in Shipping builds
* (IMPORTANT) The DebugGame build configuration now shares engine binaries with the Development configuration.
	* DebugGame causes game modules to be compiled with UE_BUILD_DEVELOPMENT, but optimization disabled. 
	* Pass -debug on the command line to tell the editor to load DebugGame game modules.
	* Delete user configuration files from Intermediate\ProjectFiles to have UBT automatically fill in the correct command line in your project settings.
* Config settings for installed builds are now stored in the user's AppData folder, rather than My Documents.
* Template projects now have a .uproject extension again.
* The engine version now has a Major.Minor.Hotfix component as well as changelist number (FEngineVersion). This version is saved into packages to allow for out of band hotfixes.
	* Modules will need to be recompiled with the correct version strings from PCLaunch.rc for the engine to load them.
* Decision to compile plugins in monolithic builds is filtered by the enabled plugin list in config files.
* LevelEditor: the "Mobile Preview" menu has been hidden, because the functionality isn't fully implemented yet
* LevelEditor: the "-PlatformTools" command line switch has been removed; the remaining features that depended on it are now accessible in the 'Experimental' section of the Editor Preferences
* Settings: many Editor User Settings have been moved into new classes and exposed as separate sections in the Settings UI; your local settings changes may have to be reapplied
* Messaging: UDP message transport is now a plug-in (UdpMessaging) that is loaded by default, but still requires "-messaging" command line switch to activate in Shipping builds and standalone games; we are planning to get rid of the switch after this prototype implementation has been rewritten for production quality; no ETA yet

#### Animation
* Allowed anim sequence and blendspace properties to be exposed as a pin in the graph.
* Added support for inheriting from an existing Anim Blueprint (allowing overriding the defaults and event graph, but not the anim graph).
* Refactored the Persona viewport toolbar and widgets, improving real estate usage and behaving similar to the level editor.
* Various bug fixes for Anim Blueprint debugging.
* Added a customization for FBoneReference structures, showing a skeleton tree picker for the bone name.
* Added filtering logic to asset pickers on anim player nodes so that only compatible assets (based on skeleton) are shown.

#### Core
* Intermediate generated files are now per-platform.
	* If you have tools which do any kind of processing on generated files, then these will need to be updated to the new locations.
* ConstCast has been removed, because it's confusingly unlike C++'s const_cast.
	* `ConstCast<T>` should be replaced with `Cast<const T>`.
* Renamed UObjectSerializer to UGCObjectReferencer and FSerializableObject to FGCObject as they do not use serialization to collect garbage anymore and may be misleading.
* Code refactoring that requires action from licensees:
	* Renamed GIsUCC to IsRunningCommandlet() (mostly)
	* Renamed USpriteComponent to UBillboardComponent
	* Renamed UMaterialSpriteComponent to UMaterialBillboardComponent

#### Platforms
* **Moblie**
	* Exposed touch input interface properties to be editable in the Settings UI.
	* Added copying of platform-specific configuration files for Android and iOS via the Settings panel.
	* Added editing for icons, launch screens, and device orientation in Project Settings.
	* Various packaging size optimizations for cooked games.
* **Android**
	* Enabled Android support directly from the editor with Package and Launch (aka One Click Deploy).
	* Packaging Android will create a .obb file next to the .apk, with a .bat to install it.
	* Packaging in Distribution needs SigningConfig.xml to be setup properly (see sample in Engine/Build/Android/Java).
	* .apk generation now only happens if .so of java files have changed.
* **Mac**
	* Mac editor works but pre-built binaries are not included with this release.
		* For now, you must compile the binaries in order to run the editor on Mac.
		* This will be resolved for the next QA build.
	* Unreal Frontend works on Mac.			
	**iOS**
	* iOS build and packaging works on Mac.
	* Various fixes and improvements to GameCenter OSS.
	* Added experimental iAD support for iOS.
	* Fixed icon glossy effect showing up on iOS6 incorrectly.
	* Forced symbol stripping to always be on for Shipping iOS builds.
	* Various improvements to the PC iOS deployment workflow (to code sign from the editor, set environment variable uebp_CodeSignWhenStaging=1, but you will have to have a valid certificate for your provision installed on the PC).
	* Merged various iPhonePackager changes from UE3 (fat binary support, fix for code signing extending beyond the preallocated size in the stub, etc...).
	
#### Networking
* A new bool has been added, bReplicates. This should be set in blueprints and C++ constructors to make an actor replicate. Setting RemoteRole=ROLE_SimulatedProxy manually is no longer necessary.

	* Kindle Fire HDX and Galaxy S4 now use FP16 render targets.

#### Blueprints
* Better categorizing of blueprint nodes in the blueprint palette/context menu.
	* We've made an initial pass to clean up the node categorization (aiming to slim down the number of categories, while making nodes more discoverable)� while it's not perfect, we continue to iterate on it, bettering it as we go.

* Changed blueprint tree display to use display names instead of object names.
* Better iterative compile times on single source files for small game modules.
	* Game modules now always get a precompiled header (faster iteration).
	* Previously, only game modules with more than 8 unity source files would get one.
		* New setting for this:  BuildConfiguration.bForcePrecompiledHeaderForGameModules.

#### Platforms
* **Mac**
	* Make adding code to projects work on OS X.
	* When exploring to a file, open the parent folder in Finder and select that file, or for folders just open them.
	* Disambiguate some C++ types that were causing crashes on Mac due to silent linker failure.
	* Make Mac OS X output log scroll to new entries.
	* Cache the window's zoomed state on Mac OS X - the objc_msgsend for isZoomed is sitting top of the profiler when running the editor!
	* Make it easier to detach window tabs on the Mac.
	* Make windows appear on editor restart on Mac OS X.
	* Stop minimized windows stealing mouse events on Mac OS X.
	* Stop crashing when trying to reshape windows on OS X.

	* Stop the level viewport graphics from fading on OS X when using sub-editors.
	* Avoid corruption when rendering temporal screen space reflections
		* Must enable NAN suppression on Mac OS X to handle differing NAN/INF conditions in GLSL.
	* When rendering particles ensure a texture buffer is bound even for lower shader models to avoid a crash.
	* Use a PBO pack, followed by a PBO unpack to copy texture mips when newer extensions aren't available to avoid synchronising the CPU & GL with glMapBuffer.
	* Eliminate one cause of slowdown when mousing over the editor.
	* Cache the hit proxy data into a byte buffer rather than calling RHIReadSurfaceData which takes a very slow glReadPixels path for OpenGL..
	* Enable seamless cube maps on all GL's that support them.
	* Eliminate distortions at viewport edge when using SSR on Mac OS X. 
	* Speed-up locking CPU readback textures and general texture readback on Mac OS X + address HZB performance.
* **Android**
	* Android now prefers R8G8B8 backbuffer format instead of R5G6B5.
	* Android is now multithreaded (using proper CPU core count check at startup).
	* Now using OpenGL ES 3.0 shaders for high-end Qualcomm Adreno GPUs.
	* GPU frametime can now be measured in `STAT UNIT`. It's disabled by default due to driver issues on some devices, but can be enabled by setting the CVar `r.DisjointTimerQueries` to 1.
	* Initial Android controller and keyboard support is in.
	* Android pause/resume behavior has been cleaned up.
	* Android builds no longer rely on a user generated standalone toolchain.  UBT calls directly into the NDK toolchains.
