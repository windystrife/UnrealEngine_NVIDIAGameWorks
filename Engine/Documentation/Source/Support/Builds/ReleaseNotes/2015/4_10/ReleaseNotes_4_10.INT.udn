# What’s New

Welcome to Unreal Engine 4.10!  This release is packed with a number of great new features, but our main focus has been to increase engine stability and fix outstanding issues.  Hundreds of reported bugs have been bashed, many new quality of life improvements were added, and virtually every supported platform has received updates.

Unreal Engine is designed for incredible VR experiences, and every release it gets better.  Epic's ["Bullet Train" VR demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmaxmnPzMWE) is powered by new features in this version, with new rendering optimizations designed specifically for head mounted displays.

Mobile gets a nice upgrade in this release too, with new scalability features and support for refraction.

Last but not least, great news for programmers:  You can now use Visual Studio 2015 for development on Windows.  And on Mac, we've revamped our Xcode projects to allow you to work more efficiently.  We've also refreshed our target platforms with support for latest SDKs.

# Major Features

## New: Refraction Effects for Mobile

Refraction effects are now fully supported on mobile platforms.  Your existing shaders with refraction will automatically work on mobile devices in this release -- no extra steps are required!

![image alt text](image_0.png)

* Enabled on iPhone 5S and above and Android devices such as Nexus 5, Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy S6

* It can be enabled on other devices by setting the r.RefractionQuality render variable in their corresponding Device Profile

## New: Optimized VR Rendering

Your VR games get faster in this release, thanks to new rendering optimizations specifically for head mounted displays.  We’ve implemented a new "Hidden and Visible Mesh optimization" to reduce the GPU overhead of VR rendering.  

![image alt text](image_1.png)

**[Bullet Train VR Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmaxmnPzMWE), by Epic Games**

![image alt text](image_2.png)

These two optimizations ensure that we do not spend GPU time working on pixels that will not be displayed in the actual device, because of lens distortions.  The hidden area mesh works as a prepass, where we take a mesh that represents the area hidden from view, and reject everything behind the mesh.  Next, for the post-processing stage, we use the inverse of that mesh, which represents the visible pixels, and then only run post processing on those.  By using these two techniques, you get "free" performance!  On “Bullet Train,” we saw about 0.25 ms total savings on the PC, where the total frame time is only 11ms.  On console platforms you can expect to see much larger performance gains!

## New: Visual Studio 2015 Support

Unreal Engine has been updated to **Visual Studio 2015 **on Windows platform! 

![image alt text](image_3.png)

Visual Studio 2015 includes [many new improvements](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/60k1461a.aspx) that should help your workflow, including support for new modern [C++ language features](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh567368.aspx) like uniform initializers and delegating constructors.  The new compiler is also very standards-compliant and will detect more errors in your code.

You can download the free **Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition** [right here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532606).  For other versions, head over to the [Visual Studio web site](http://www.visualstudio.com).  Unreal Engine supports Visual Studio 2015 Community, Professional, Enterprise as well as Express for Desktop (with some limitations.)

**Important: ** The launcher distribution of the engine now **requires Visual Studio 2015 with C++ support enabled**.  Please upgrade your team now!  If you use the New Project wizard inside Unreal Engine, we’ll help you get Visual Studio 2015 downloaded and installed.

**Important: ** The Visual Studio 2015 installer does not install C++ by default when installing manually.  Make sure to choose "**Custom**" when prompted, then expand the **Programming Languages** section, and check **Visual C++**. 

When compiling your project the first time, be on the lookout for new compiler errors reported because the new C++ compiler is more strict.  Microsoft has posted [this](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb531344.aspx)[ document](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb531344.aspx) with examples of changes that could affect your code.

 

If you need to continue using Visual Studio 2013, you’ll need to compile the engine yourself from the GitHub source code.  The primary reason for not supporting Visual Studio 2013 in the launcher distribution is because the additional precompiled binaries, debug symbols and static libraries for both versions of the compiler would have significantly increased the engine size and caused project setup to be more complicated on Windows.  We’ll be fully retiring support for Visual Studio 2013 in an upcoming release. 

## New: Mobile Material Quality

The new Material Quality system allows your game to easily scale all the way down to low end devices, without sacrificing quality on more modern devices!

You can now generate Low, Medium and High quality versions of shaders for all materials!  With each tier, you can selectively disable rendering features to increase performance on low end devices.  UE4 will automatically detect a good default quality level for many popular devices.

![image alt text](image_4.png)(convert:false)

**Galaxy S6 Edge (High quality materials)**

![image alt text](image_5.png)(w:640)

* High material quality automatically selected

* Specular reflections, roughness, metals, normal maps and directional lighting

**Galaxy S III (Material quality scaled down)**

![image alt text](image_6.png)(w:640)

* Material quality automatically scaled for optimal performance

* Specular reflections, variation in roughness, metals, normal maps and directional lighting are disabled

## New: UE4 Platform Updates and SDKs

Every release of UE4 contains improvements for supported platforms along with updated support for latest platform SDKs

![image alt text](image_7.png)

Platform highlights in this release:

* Oculus Rift updated to support 0.8 SDK Beta

* Oculus Mobile SDK updated to support 0.6.2

* Xbox One was updated to the August XDK and now compiles using Visual Studio 2015

* Playstation 4 was updated to SDK 3.00 (with Playstation VR support!)

* iOS support was updated to SDK 9.0

* Mac OS X was updated to SDK 10.11 (El Capitan)

* Xcode support was updated for Version 7

* Android now supports Marshmallow (6.0)

* Ongoing fixes to Linux/SteamOS, and minor improvements in lower level functionality.

## New: Landscape Mirror Tool

Using the new Mirror Tool you can easily make symmetrical landscapes.  This is really useful for competitive two-team landscape levels!

![](image_8.gif)(convert:false)

* Mirrors the heightmap, material layers and landscape grass 

* Mirror in either direction over the X or Y axis

## New: Low-latency VR Motion Controllers

We’ve updated Motion Controller Components to now do a late-update right before we begin rendering.  You can see the difference between a late-updated and a non-late-updated component’s position and rotation below.  The screenshot was taken during a normal speed, side-to-side arm motion.

![image alt text](image_9.png)(convert:false)

This is the same technique that we use to reduce latency with head mounted displays.  We now update Motion Controller Component positions twice per frame:  once during the input tick, and once again right before we render.  That means that controls will feel more responsive, and better reflect what the player is doing in the real world.  This feature is enabled by default.  

## New: Automatic Blueprint Node Arrangement

We’ve added a comprehensive set of layout routines for fast automatic organization of Blueprint graphs. 

![](image_10.gif)(convert:false)

Just right click on selected nodes and choose "Alignment" to automatically arrange those nodes.  

Here’s what you can do with this feature:

* Aligning the selected nodes based on their bounds (Top/Middle/Bottom, Left/Center/Right).

* Distributing the selected nodes along a horizontal/vertical axis.

* Straightening connections between the selected nodes.

* Straightening a specific link connected to a particular pin.

## New: Web Browser UI on Android

Android now supports Web Browser widgets created either in a Widget Blueprint or in C++ using Slate code. This can be used to display content hosted anywhere on the web, for example a news messages to your users or help text.

![image alt text](image_11.png)(convert:false)

* On Android, the platform’s native web control is used so there is no increase in the executable size.

* Web Browser widgets will be supported on iOS in a future release.

## New: Gamepad Features for Android

Multiple gamepads are now supported for Android along with identifying some common controller types and mappings.  

The following Android controllers are automatically detected. Others will fall back to generic mappings.

## Amazon Fire Game Controller and Amazon Fire TV remote

![image alt text](image_12.png)(convert:false)

## NVIDIA SHIELD Controller and SHIELD Portable

![image alt text](image_13.png)(convert:false)

## Samsung Game Pad EI-GP20

![image alt text](image_14.png)(convert:false)

Other new features for Android controllers:

* Mappings are now detected automatically based on the name of the controller device

* Multiple controllers are now supported simultaneously

* We now handle both Z/RZ and RX/RY mappings of axes to right joystick

* Left Trigger / Brake and Right Trigger / Gas axes now work properly

* X/Y Hat now maps to directional pad button events

Quick note about supporting more than one controller at the same time:  Pressing a button on an unassigned gamepad will now associate the device ID with the first unassigned controller ID.  Gamepad to controller ID assignments may also be queried or cleared with three new Blueprint nodes:

![image alt text](image_15.png)

## New: Xcode Project Overhaul

We’ve greatly improved how Xcode projects are generated for your game!  You’ll now have access to Xcode’s live issues and "Fix It" features, and indexing is much faster.  Plus it’s way easier to switch between build configurations!

Instead of a single project containing multiple targets we now have a workspace consisting of multiple projects, one per target. You now open UE4.xcworkspace instead of UE4.xcodeproj in Xcode.  Each project in the workspace creates a single scheme that’s used to build various UE4 targets. What is being built and run is determined by active configuration and platform.

**UE4 Target selection in Xcode:**

![image alt text](image_16.png)(convert:false)

[REGION:caption]New target selection on the left, old on the right.[/REGION]

**UE4 Build Configurations in Xcode:**

![image alt text](image_17.png)(convert:false)

You’ll no longer have to worry about which executable to run. Xcode will automatically choose the correct app when you switch build configurations. *Please note that changing the active configuration does not update the Executable drop down in the scheme editor, that’s a known issue with Xcode*. It will, however, use the correct app when you run from Xcode.

![image alt text](image_18.png)(convert:false)

*Even though StrategyGame.app is shown, the StrategyGameEditor.app will be launched!*

Project indexing should now be faster and more accurate. Additionally, live issues are displayed and Xcode’s Fix-it system works now:

![image alt text](image_19.png)(convert:false)

## New: Mobile Provisioning Profile Selector

Users are now able to explicitly select a mobile provision and certificate in the iOS Project Settings. Previously, a "best match" provision and certificate were used (and highlighted in green, as seen below). Now, there are check boxes next to them which will allow a particular provision or certificate to be used instead of the best match. If no items are selected, the green ones will be used.

![image alt text](image_20.png)(convert:false)

* Bugfix: User Defined Enums begin counting at 0, and will no longer increase in increments of two.

* New placements of the Get Class Defaults node will no longer include array properties that contain object references. This is because it is a potentially unsafe connection.

    * As a side note, object properties are also not exposed for the same reason.

* The Blueprint details view for non-member variables (either from a parent class or an external member reference), will no longer show uneditable options as editable.

* The Get Class Defaults node now exposes Class and Interface variables.

* Graph node comment bubbles have been improved so that they don’t obscure input pins on array graph node types.

## Core

* New: Cooked packages can now be loaded in the editor if cooked for the same non-editor version of the platform the editor runs on.

* New: Optimized custom version system so that it takes less space in saved packages and is faster to access at runtime.

* Bugfix: Crash fix on deleting an Animation Blueprint and replacing it with another one.

* Bugfix: Fixed high memory usage by streaming packages in cooked builds.

* Bugfix: When using command line executable, only the call stack was visible after a crash. Now, the whole error history should be dumped to the console.

* Bugfix: Crash report client should be packaged correctly now for all projects.

## Editor and Tools

* New: Added a new experimental editor preference to enable "Sequencer"!

    * Sequencer is our upcoming level actor animation and cinematics creation tool.

    * The current version is limited in features and lacks documentation.  It’s enabled for pre-alpha testing.

    * Sequencer is still in heavy development and you can expect to see major improvements with every release.

    * If you are brave enough to try it out, please be sure to send feedback on the forums or AnswerHub!

* New: "Reset to default" button on the Image Size property of a brush now resets to the size of the brush's texture, if one is set.

* New: Actor Merging tool now supports merging of collision primitives.

* New: Added a feature allowing Detail Panel categories to be shown or hidden dynamically.

* New: Added a Launch Configuration setting to the Play on Device editor settings tab, allowing you to specify the build configuration you want to use when launching from the editor Launch button drop-down menu.

    * This also fixes an inconsistency where source code projects would build and launch the same configuration the editor is running, but Blueprint projects always launched using a Development configuration.

    * The default setting is now to launch with the same configuration as the editor, but any build configuration can be specified.

* New: Added a new editor view mode to colorize objects based on their LOD.

    * Enable from the view mode menu, or using the "viewmode lodcoloration" console command.

    * The colors to use for each LOD are configured in BaseEngine.ini under LOD Coloration Colors.

* New: Added ability to merge physics data (collision primitives) for Actor Merging tool.

* New: Added support to UnrealBuildTool to rebuild the makefile whenever the user changes a BuildConfiguration.xml file.

* New: Added template to the Plugin Creator that shows how to add an example Third Party library.

* New: Changed how actor spawning / duplication works in Simulate in Editor.

    * Now actors are always spawned non-permanently into the SIE world, and are destroyed upon exiting SIE.

    * This is more in line with other property changes to actors, which are restored to their original state when exiting SIE.

* New: 'Device Output Log' window, currently implemented only for Android devices. Hidden under editor experimental settings.

* New: Editor Analytics now tracks abnormal termination and crash events in order to improve stability.

* New: Editor Analytics shutdown reporting improvements.

    * Discounts abnormal termination when a debugger is attached.

    * Improved locking of shared resources when running multiple instances to avoid missed reports.

* New: Improved Engine Analytics settings for Editor users and End-Users of games.

    * Editor users can enable/disable their own analytics that sends usage data for their Editor sessions in "Editor Preferences->Privacy->Usage Data->Options".

    * Editor users can set the default game analytics enabled state for the end-users of their game in "Project Settings->Engine->End-User Settings->Privacy".

    * End-user's setting is easy to expose to your game UI and should be presented as an option to send usage data to Epic Games.

* Both settings are for sending analytics to Epic Games. Developers are free to add their own analytics.

* New: Improving SuperSearch to allow you to choose Google (default) or Bing as the search engine to use. In China, Google is blocked, so Bing will allow those users to use the builtin search.

* New: The process of duplicating Brushes in the editor has now been hugely optimized.

    * In a test level with 227 brushes, these are now duplicated in around 2 seconds instead of nearly 4 minutes as before.

    * A dialog has been added to show progress on the operation if it takes more than a few seconds.

* Bugfix: Crash fix to project thumbnails using corrupted PNG images. Error handling is now fixed in PNG Image Wrapper to prevent this from crashing the editor.

* Bugfix: Crash fix to editor startup. Previous, it was crashing while loading tutorial images.

* Bugfix: Crash fix when putting Recast NavMesh into a World Outliner folder.

* Bugfix: Crash fix when setting a struct variable to Curve Table Row Handle.

* Bugfix: Crash fix when expanding the viewport toolbar while in 2x2 view.

* Bugfix: Crash fix when freelooking in editor viewports due to view rotation matrix calculation bug.

* Bugfix: Crash fix when importing invalid FBX files.

* Bugfix: Crash fix to renaming asset files outside of the editor while the editor is open.

* Bugfix: Brush extrusion now works correctly when a Brush actor is rotated.

* Bugfix: Duplicating an array of instanced objects in a Property Tree will correctly deep copy the objects instead of a shallow (referenced) copy.

* Bugfix: Clicking a Text property field corresponding to multiple properties will no longer cause the "Multiple Values" text to be committed to those properties.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue where widget deltas were not being correctly calculated when the widget was positioned behind the camera. This had meant that Ctrl+Mouse Button dragging to move the currently selected actor(s) along one of their axes was not working if the widget was behind the camera.

* Bugfix: Fixed Search Box widgets in context menus (for example, the search box in the Blueprint Editor context menu) so that clicking the clear button doesn't also close the parent menu.

* Bugfix: Win DualShock plugin now links in Debug Editor mode.

* Bugfix: Merge Actors tool correctly replaces the source actors with a merged one.

* Bugfix: Mirrored blocking volumes now correctly generate collision geometry.

## Content Browser

* New: Content browser asset discovery optimized. (Contributed by slonopotamus, Pull Request #1516.)

* Bugfix: Newly added collections don’t lose their selection state once you name them.

* Can no longer duplicate maps via the content browser.

## Landscape

* New: Added a mirroring tool to allow you to mirror Landscape geometry and layers using a plane.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash with landscape that has painted holes when using ES2 feature level preview or the Mobile Previewer.

* Bugfix: Fixed a race condition in material compilation that may have been causing a hard-to-reproduce crash during landscape painting.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue where a None entry in the Landscape Grass Output node would cause landscape grass meshes to be assigned to the wrong layer.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue where landscape grass with more than 5 layers only showed the last layer.

* Bugfix: Landscape "move to level" tool doesn’t get stuck when moving components, including after the user releases the mouse.

* Bugfix: Undoing deleted landscape components no longer leaves them uneditable.

* Bugfix: Landscape grass no longer leaves "Lighting needs to be rebuilt" warning after a static lighting build.

* Landscape Grass no longer wastes memory storing empty grass map data for areas of the landscape which don't have any grass instances.

* Removed the Layer Debug viewport view mode menu item when not in landscape edit mode.

    * This view mode it doesn't make sense without the layer checkboxes.

    * Enabling it outside landscape edit mode would previously cause the landscape to disappear.

## Material Editor

* Bugfix: Duplicate entries no longer appear in the results of searches in the Material Editor context menu.

## Matinee

* Bugfix: Editor no longer hangs when pressing "F" to frame an object while Matinee has a locked actor defined.

* Audio tracks will now start playing from the correct position when scrubbing in matinee.

## Persona:

* Bugfix: Crash fix related to state machines, states, and transitions when undoing and redoing deletions and creations.

## PhAT:

* New: Added Field of View slider to PhAT editor view.

## Source Control:

* Added support for the 64-bit git executable to the Git Source Control plugin on windows. (Contributed by SRombauts, Pull Request #1538.)

## World Browser:

* Bugfix: World composition no longer allows layers to be created with non-unique names.

* Bugfix: Handled a potential issue with Hot Reload while World Composition window is open.

## Foliage:

* New: Visibility for each foliage mesh type can be switched on/off per Editor viewport.

* Bugfix: Crash fix when assigning a new Static Mesh to Foliage that is painted across multiple levels.

* Bugfix: Foliage selection highlight no longer remains after an undo operation.

* Added a "Use as Occluder" checkbox to the foliage tool to allow foliage to correctly receive D-Buffer decals.

## Cooker:

* New: Stopped some editor debug content which wasn't required at run time from being cooked.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with modified content not getting deployed to the devkit when the project folder name and project name don't match.

* Bugfix: Added missing parameters like "cookall" to File -> Cook editor feature.

* Cooking warning related to Persona tutorial will no longer appear.

* Disabled some slow editor cooking stats.

* StableSort is used to sort .pak files in order to preserve previous sorting by file. (Contributed by Shaijan, Pull Request #1377.)

## Gameplay Framework

* New: Allow binding of the Section (§) key.

* New: Blueprints can now draw circles via the Debug Draw Circle node.

* Changed UTextRenderComponent to respond to the culture being changed, rather than constantly tick.

* Child Actors will no longer become disconnected from their parent when using SetClass.

* Bugfix: Crash fix when detaching child components if an On Attachment Change implementation also detaches a sibling component.

* Bugfix: Fixed a potential infinite loop case in post-transform navmesh updates that could lead to a crash.

## Content Examples

* Removed the Blur G-Buffer stand in the Post Processing content examples map, as that feature has been removed for some time.

## Localization

* Bugfix: Crash fix on Windows (Chinese version) when changing editor language.

## Networking

* New: The replay streaming system can now scrub to a new time while playback is paused. Try it out in ShooterGame!

* Bugfix: The output log no longer spams "no owning connection" warnings when a client uses the "ToggleDebugCamera" console command.

## Other

* New: Added in support for haptic feedback effects, which use curves of amplitude and frequency to define the response players feel in their motion controllers.

* New: Updated Oculus Mobile SDK (GearVR) to version 0.6.2.

* New: Updated Oculus SDK to 0.8.

* Bugfix: Fixed improper reporting of Is HMD Enabled.

## Physics

* Bugfix: Fixed precision issues with physics handles where rotation had to be fairly large to update target on PhysX.

* When entering "show collision" from the console, builder brushes are no longer rendered as they are now an internal detail and not intended to be viewed.

## Platforms

* New: Default movie player now has an optional bWaitForManualStop flag to prevent continuing until movie is explicitly stopped.

* New: Support for PNG and JPG splash screen images added on Linux, Mac, Windows. (Contributed by labidus, Pull Request #1444, and x414e54, Pull Request #1399.)

* Bugfix: Android build and iOS build and orientation setting overrides now save to .ini properly.

* Bugfix: Pinch events now trigger correctly every time.

* The correct texture LOD bias is now used when cooking.

* Added Touch Event Locations to pair with touch events since we want the actual location for that event. After a release, the finger ID may be reused for another touch far from the location of the release so the wrong location would be sent for all the events.

* Fixed editor primitives (e.g. debug wireframes) rendering flipped upside down on OpenGL ES2.

## Android

* New: Support for an optional launch screen for Android projects. 

    * A "Show launch image" checkbox in the Android Platform section of the Project Settings enables this feature.  Examples for portrait and landscape may be found in Engine/Build/Android/Java/res/drawable as PNG files.  

    * Click on the "..." link next to the image in the Launch Images section of the Android Platform section to bring up a browser to copy your own image into the project.  

    * If the launch image is enabled, either or both launch images selected for the project will be included depending on the orientation setting in the project.

* New: Added new targetSdkVersion setting for AndroidManifest.xml to allow overriding default minSdkVersion value.

* Bugfix: Fixed backslashes in path for Android plugin XML on Mac.

* New: Device Profile detection mechanism has been changed so that new Android devices can be detected and assigned a Device Profile using user-specified rules.

    * Instead of being hardcoded in C++, the matching rules are now specified in BaseDeviceProfiles.ini in the [/Script/AndroidDeviceProfileSelector.AndroidDeviceProfileMatchingRules] section.

* New: First implementation of Slate Web Browser for Android.

* New: It is now possible to package for a selected set of Android texture formats rather than just all or one.

    * Check the checkboxes for the formats you wish to cook for in the Platforms, Android project settings tab.

    * Select the Android_Multi cook variant when packaging.

* New: FCachedReadPlatformFile is off by default on Windows since WindowsPlatformFile already caches the reads.

## Mac

* Improved error handling in Mac media player.

## Android

* New: A new Android plugin system is included in 4.10 and the GearVR plugin now uses it. Changes to the generated AndroidManifest.xml, proguard-project.xt, and GameActivity.java may be made during packaging along with staging files by adding an AndroidPlugin property in their build.cs to reference an XML file containing commands; see GearVR.build.cs and GearVR_APL.xml for an example. AndroidPluginLanguage.cs documents the commands available.

* Fixed Resolution cache RequestedContentScaleFactor log message.

* Fixed compile errors in GearVR plugin for non ARMv7 targets.

# Upgrade Notes

## C++ API Changes

* Multiple AdMob IDs may now be entered and Show Ad Banner now takes an index. New Get Ad ID Count Blueprint node returns the array size.  ShowAdBanner() method in advertising provider now takes an int32 Ad ID Index.

* Fixed return value of the HexToBytes function.  Code which uses the return value of HexToBytes should be aware that the return value is now 1 more than before.

* UPackage::PackageFlags made private.  UPackage::PackageFlags has been deprecated and should no longer be set or read directly. Use Get/Set/Clear/HasAny/HasAll PackageFlags instead.

* "Reset to default" button on the Image Size property of a brush now resets to the size of the brush's texture, if one is set.  IDetailPropertyRow::OverrideResetToDefault() parameters have changed to take a single parameter of type FResetToDefaultOverride that defines the override behavior.

## Blueprints

* New placements of a GetClassDefaults node in a Blueprint function graph will no longer expose array properties that contain object references. This is currently needed in order to prevent mutation of a default object that belongs to an owning class.

    * Existing placements will preserve any exposed property whose default value is an array of object references, but the Blueprint compiler will now emit an "unsafe connection" warning in this case, as it's a potential risk, as we don't currently support read-only object references in a Blueprint.

## Xbox One

* The default Xbox One XDK has been updated to August 2015. A minimum XDK version of August 2015 is required to build using the Visual Studio 2015 XDK version on Xbox One.
