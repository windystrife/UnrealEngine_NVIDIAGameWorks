By now, you've learned how to configure your IDE to run UE4 in a Linux environment. Also, you've learned how to create a new Blueprint project using a Project template. In this section, we'll show you 
how to create a new CPP project from UE4. For the purposes of this demonstration, let's suppose that you want to create a new CPP game with a driving mechanic.

1.	While in the **New Project** menu, make sure that the **C++** menu is open.

1.	Select the **Vehicle** CPP project template and name the project `DrivingCPP_Prj`.

1.	Finally, click the **Create Project** button to create your new CPP project using the Vehicle CPP project template.

	[REGION:note]
	Depending on your system specifications, it may take a couple of minutes for UE4 to create your new CPP project. 
	After UE4 creates your new CPP project, an instance of Qt Creator for your new CPP project will be launched, closing UE4Editor in the process.
	[/REGION]

1.	At this point, you should see Qt Creator's **Configure Project** menu in the newly launched instance of Qt Creator. Use what you've learned thus far to configure your new CPP project to have the following Build Settings for Debug Mode;

	And Release Mode:

	[REGION:note]
	At this time, project settings aren't inherited from the original UE4 Editor project settings. So, when you create a new UE4 CPP project using Qt Creator, you'll need to configure 
	the project settings using the same steps that you learned earlier in this guide.

1.	Now, configure your new CPP project to have the following Run Settings:

1.	Switch to **Edit** mode in your IDE by clicking on the **Edit** button in the left panel of your IDE. Alternatively, you can press the **Ctrl+2** keyboard combination to open Qt Creator's **Edit Mode**.

1.	After the **Missing DriveCPP_Prj Modules** dialogue box appears, click the **Yes** button.
