%Steps%

Now that you've set up Git on your Linux machine, you're ready to download the Unreal Engine source code from our [GitHub site](http://github.com/EpicGames). There 
are a couple of ways to download the UE4 source code, one way is to use the download feature on our GitHub page, and the other way is to clone the Unreal 
Engine repository with your Git client. We'll cover both ways on this page.

## Downloading from GitHub

1.	First, select the branch you want to download by clicking the **Branch:** button on the left side of the page. For more info on branches in the Unreal Engine GitHub repository, please see the [](GettingStarted/DownloadingUnrealEngine/SourceBranches) page.
