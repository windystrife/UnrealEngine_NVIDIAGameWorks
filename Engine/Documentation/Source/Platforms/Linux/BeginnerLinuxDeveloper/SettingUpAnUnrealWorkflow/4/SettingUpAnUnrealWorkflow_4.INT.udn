%Steps%

As you worked your way to this final step, you linked your Epic Games account with your GitHub username, you downloaded the Unreal Engine source code from our 
GitHub site, and you compiled a binary of UE4 on your Linux system. The only remaining task is for you to run the UE4 Editor so that you can start making 
games for the Linux platform.

## Launching UE4 on Linux

Because you've compiled the engine from its source code on Linux, the engine will compile shaders for a few minutes after launching UE4.

## Creating your First Project

If you haven't already set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to work with UE4, we recommend that you start out by creating a **Blueprint** project.
