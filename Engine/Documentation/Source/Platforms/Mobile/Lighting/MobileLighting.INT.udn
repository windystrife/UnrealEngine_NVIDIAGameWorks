When using lights on mobile platforms in UE4, certain caveats and restrictions must be adhered to make sure that your UE4 project will run, at the proper frame, on many different mobile devices. In the following document, we will go over what these caveats and restrictions are and how you can avoid or work around them.

## Supported Features

The features listed below are supported on mobile platforms:

* Linear HDR lighting.
* Directional Lightmaps (Normal is taken into account).
* Distance field shadows + analytical specular on the sun.
* Image based specular lighting - nearest [Reflection Capture](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/ReflectionEnvironment/) is applied to each object, without parallax correction. So there can be seams between objects.
* Dynamic objects receive lighting correctly but do not cast shadows.

## Supported Light Types

Mobile platforms only support a subset of the light types available in Unreal Engine. These are:

| Type | Additional Info |
| ---- | --------------- |
| Stationary Directional Light | Directional Light with **Mobility = Stationary**. Best quality. |
| Static Directional Light | Directional Light with **Mobility = Static**. Best performance (no distance field shadows or sun specular). |
| Static Point Light | Point Light with **Mobility = Static**. |
| Static Spot Light | Spot Light with **Mobility = Static**. |

## Reflections
While reflections can help to breathe life and believability into your mobile projects, there are a few caveats you need to be aware of when using them on mobile devices. Below you will find a list of some of the things you will need to do to ensure that reflections will work on your target mobile device.

* Disable any Ambient Cubemaps you have in your post process volumes by setting the **Intensity** to **0**.

* Place [**SphereReflectionCaptures**](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/ReflectionEnvironment/#sphereshape) Actors in the areas that you want to capture lighting for reflections.

	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Sphere Reflection Captures On](Reflection_Probes_On.png)(w:800 h:473)
	[/PARAM]
	[/OBJECT]

* When making Materials the support reflections keep the following information in mind. 

	* Make sure your Normal maps has lots of high and low frequency detail in it as this helps to break up the reflection making it more visually interesting.

		![Flat Normal Map ](Interesting_Normal_Map_00.png)(w:800 h:473)
		[/PARAM]
		[PARAM:after]
		![Rough Normal Map](Interesting_Normal_Map_01.png)(w:800 h:473)
		[/PARAM]
		[/OBJECT]

	* Make sure your Roughness maps have varying intensities of whites and blacks as this will help to give you a varying degree of shiny and dull reflections.

		[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
		[PARAM:before]
		![Varying Roughness ](Interesting_Roughness_Map_00.png)(w:624 h:723)
		[/PARAM]
		[PARAM:after]
		![Flat Roughness](Interesting_Roughness_Map_01.png)(w:624 h:723)
		[/PARAM]
		[/OBJECT]

	* Depending on the surface type the Metallic input should be a 1 or 0.

		[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
		[PARAM:before]
		![Metallic Off](Metallic_Off.png)(w:341 h:600)
		[/PARAM]
		[PARAM:after]
		![Metallic On](Metallic_On.png)(w:341 h:600)
		[/PARAM]
		[/OBJECT]

Note that each Static Mesh component gets assigned to the closest [**Reflection Capture**](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/ReflectionEnvironment/). That means there will be seams in reflections between objects, and sometimes a large mesh will use an undesirable reflection capture that happened to be close to the mesh's center. 

## Modulated Shadowing

Fully Dynamic shadows help to add life and realism to your mobile projects. 
However, on some mobile devices, fully Dynamic shadowing is not an option due to hardware restrictions and the high resource demands Dynamic shadows require to render. To get around this a new, cheaper type of Dynamic shadowing was introduced to UE4 called **Modulated Shadows**. For more information on how to setup Modulated Shadows check out using [**Modulated Shadows**](Platforms/Mobile/Lighting/HowTo/ModulatedShadows/).

## Dynamic Cascaded Shadow Maps
Stationary Directional lights can be used to cast Whole-scene Dynamic Cascade Shadow Maps (CSM) shadows for just the dynamic objects in your scene. One of the benefits to using CSM shadows is that they will blend correctly with precomputed shadows cast by the static objects in the scene. CSM shadows also do not exhibit the double shadowing you see with Modulated shadows and are faster when casting dynamic shadows for multiple objects. For more information on how to setup Cascaded Shadows, check out using [**Cascaded Shadows**](Platforms\Mobile\Lighting\HowTo\CascadedShadow\).

## Modulated Shadowing VS Dynamic Shadowing

While Modulated and Dynamic shadowing looks and acts very similar to one another, they are quite different. 
This is because Modulated shadows have a number of restrictions and hard limits that Dynamic shadows do not have that allows them to perform better on mobile devices with limited hardware capabilities.
In the image below you can see a comparison between Dynamic shadows and Modulated shadows.

The following list highlights some of the features and restrictions Modulated shadows can provide if used in your UE4 project.

* **Changing Shadow Color:** You can change the color of the shadow that Modulated shadows cast by adjusting the **Modulated Shadow Color** option in the **Light** section of the Directional Light. This is useful if you want to adjust the color of your shadows for game play or artistic reasons.

* **Shadow Blending:** Unlike Dynamic shadows, Modulated shadows can not blend with other shadows, either baked or dynamic, that you see in your project's. This means that when a Modulated shadow is on top of another shadow, both shadows will show instead of a single shadow that blends together.

## Working with Modulated and Dynamic Shadows

When working with Modulated and Dynamic shadows, there are a few console and .INI settings that can be used to adjust the look and performance of the shadows. In the following section, we will take a look at these settings and how they can be applied to your UE4 project.

[region:note]
As much as possible, Modulated shadows share code with the existing shadow tech. 
This means many of the shadow cvars and .INI settings that can be used with other shadowing methods will also work with both Modulated and Dynamic shadows.
[/region]

* **Shadow Quality:** When you first view dynamic shadows on a mobile device, the sharpness and quality of the Modulated shadows could be a bit lower than expected. To address this, you can adjust the shadow quality by opening up the Unreal console, using the backtick ` key, and enter the following command, **r.shadowquality** followed by a number. The higher number you input, the better the Modulated shadow will look at the expense of FPS. In the following image, r.shadowquality was set to values of **0**, **1**, **2**, **3**, **4** and **5** to show what effect this has on the Modulated shadow quality.

	[/REGION]

* **Self Shadowing:** Modulated shadows will provide self-shadowing on dynamic objects, like characters or pickups, however by default this feature was disabled to ensure that Modulated shadows could perform as well as possible. 
If your project can afford the extra cost self-shadowing requires, you can enable it by inputting **r.Shadow.EnableModulatedSelfShadow 1** into the UE4 console.
To disable self shadowing, input **r.Shadow.EnableModulatedSelfShadow 0** into the UE4 console.

		![Self Shadow On](SS_On.png)(h:600)
		[/PARAM]
		[PARAM:after]
		![Self Shadow Off](SS_Off.png)
		[/PARAM]
	[/OBJECT]

* **Shadow Depth:** Using the command **r.Shadow.CSMDepthBias** you can offset the position at which the shadow starts to render. 
In the image below you can see what happens to the Modulated shadows when r.Shadow.CSMDepthBias is left at the default value of **0** and then set to values of **10**, **100**, **500**, **1000** and **1500**.
