In-game advertisements enable you to display ads to players of your game on mobile platforms. This provides a means of monetizing your game while allowing it to remain completely free to the player.

[EXCERPT:Usage]
## Showing the Ad Banner

The **Show Ad Banner** function is used to display an ad banner in your game. Call it somewhere in the logic where you want to show an ad, such as when the main menu is shown.

**In Blueprints:**

The example below is from the Unreal Match 3 sample game, which displays an ad banner when the victory/defeat screen is shown using the **Construct** event of that Widget Blueprint:

See the [Show Ad Banner](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/BlueprintAPI/Utilities/Platform/ShowAdBanner/index.html) reference for more information on the node.

## Hiding the Ad Banner

The **Hide Ad Banner** functions hides the visible ad banner. Call it when you no longer want the ad to be displayed, such as when you exit the main menu.

**In Blueprints:**

The example below is from the Unreal Match 3 sample game, which hides the ad banner when the victory/defeat screen is exited using the **Destruct** event of that Widget Blueprint:
