Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) offers support for displaying videos or images while a level loads when using Oculus, Gear VR, SteamVR, and PSVR Head Mounted Displays (HMDs). The loading movie or image will run on the rendering thread and can also help to mask frame rate issues while your content is loading. In the following document, we will take a look at how you can set these VR **Splash Screens** in your UE4 projects.

## VR Splash Screen Supported Platforms 

VR Splash Screens will work on the following VR platforms. 

* [Oculus VR](https://www.oculus.com/)
* [Steam VR](http://store.steampowered.com/steamvr)
* [PSVR](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-vr/)
* [Gear VR](http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-vr/)
* [Google Daydream](https://vr.google.com/daydream/)

## VR Splash Screen Project Setup

Before you can setup and use the VR Splash Screens you will first need to create a new **Game Mode** and **Pawn** Blueprint to make it easier to work with the VR Splash Screens. In the following section, we will go over what Blueprints need to be created and how they need to be set up.

1. Right-click in the **Content Browser**, and from the **Create Basic Asset** list select the **Blueprint Class** option.

    ![](VRLS_Intro_01.png)

1. In the **All Classes** section of the **Pick Parent Class** dialogue box, search for **Game Mode**. When Game Mode is located, select it and then press the **Select** button and give it a name of **VR_GameMode**.

1. Repeat the above process, but this time select the **Pawn** option from the Pick Parent Class dialogue box and call this new Pawn, **VR_Pawn**.

1. Open up the VR_GameMode Blueprint and in the **Classes** section, set the **Default Pawn Class** to the VR_Pawn that was created. When completed, Compile and Save the VR_Gamemode Blueprint.

Now that the Pawn and Game Mode have been set up, we will take a look at how to set up a VR Splash Screen in your Pawn's **Event Graph**. 

## VR Splash Screen Setup

In the following section, we will go over how you set up a VR Splash Screen in your Pawns Event Graph. 

[region:note]
Please note that this example shows the quickest way to get the Auto Loading Splash screens working in your project. When using this in production you will need to make sure to manually show and hide the Splash Screens during level transitions to make sure that you account for the time it takes for a level to finish streaming in.
[/region]

1. Open up VR_Pawn to the **Event Graph** and the following Blueprint nodes to the Event Graph:

    * [**Enable Auto Loading Splash Screen**](Platforms\VR\SplashScreens\VRSplashScreenNodeReference#EnableAutoLoadingSplashScreen)
    * [**Set Splash Screen**](Platforms\VR\SplashScreens\VRSplashScreenNodeReference#SetSplashScreen)
    * [**Hide Splash Screen**](Platforms\VR\SplashScreens\VRSplashScreenNodeReference#HideSplashScreen)

1. With the nodes now added to the Event graph, arrange and connect the nodes so that they match the setup in the following image.

1. Since we want the VR Splash Screen to load any time a level is loaded, on the Enable Auto Loading Splash Screen node, check the **In Auto Show Enabled**.

1. The Set Splash Screen node is where you specify which Texture to use for the VR Splash Screen. To set a VR Splash Screen Texture, select a Texture in the Content Browser and then press the small white arrow in the Texture section of the Set Splash Screen node to use that Texture as the VR splash screen.

    [region:note]
    For this example, a noise Texture was created in Photoshop and then imported into UE4 and used. Feel free to use any Texture you want for this section.
    [/region]
    [region:warning]
    If you are targeting **SteamVR**, you will need to make sure that you set the **Compression Settings** of the Texture you are using for the Splash Screen to **UserInterface2D(RGBA)** or it will not be displayed when the Splash Screen is called.

    [/region]

1. Finally, on the Set Splash Screen node check the **Show on Set** option to make sure that the Texture you specified is displayed when a level is loaded.

With the VRSplash Screen now set up in the next section, we will take a look at how to go about calling the VR Splash Screen when a new level is loaded.

## VR Splash Screen Use

Now that we have the Pawn set up to use the VR Splash Screens, we will go over how to display the VR Splash Screens when a level is loaded.

1. For this to work, you will need to create **two** levels that we can load. To create the levels, go to the **Main Toolbar** and select the **File** > **New Level** option. When the **New Level** popup box is displayed, select the **Default** level option.

    [/REGION]

1. Inside of the **Content Browser**, press the **Save All** button and name the new level **Level_00**. Once it has saved, right-click on Level_00, and select the **Duplicate** option. Name the duplicate **Level_01**. When all of that is completed, you should now have two new levels in the Content Browser, like in the image below:

    [/REGION]

    Click for full image.
    [/REGION]

1. Open up each level and go to **World Settings** > **Game Mode** and the **Game Mode Override** to the VR_GameMode Blueprint that was created. This way, we can be sure that the correct Pawn will be used when the level is loaded.

    ![](VLI_NewLevel_06.png)

1. Open up the VR_Pawn Blueprint and in the Event Graph, add key inputs for the **R** and **T** keys.

    [/REGION]

1. Right-click on the Event Graph and search for the **Open Level** Blueprint node. Add it to the Event Graph. Connect the **Pressed** output for the T key to the Open Level input and enter **Level_00** in the **Level Name** field.

    [/REGION]

1. Select the Open Level node and then press **CTRL + W** on the keyboard to duplicate it. Connect the **Pressed** output for the R key to the new Open Level node and change the name of the Level to **Level_01**.

1. Push the **Compile** and **Save** buttons to compile and save your Pawn Blueprint and then launch your project using the VR Preview.

1. Put your HMD on and then press the **R** key to load Level_01. While the level is being loaded, you should see the image that you specified in the Texture input of the Set Splash Screen node. Once Level_01 loads press the **T** key to load Level_00, and you should now see the same image being displayed.

With the ability to change levels on button presses now working, the next step would be to set this up so that it will work when a player enters a Level Streaming Volume or trigger as you would in any game or interactive project.
