## Running A VR Game
Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) now offers a number of different ways to run your Virtual Reality(VR) project depending on what your needs are. 
In the following section, we will cover the most common ways to run your UE4 VR projects for inside and outside of the UE4 editor.  

[region:note]

### Running from the UE4 Editor
With the release of UE4 version 4.7 and later you can now view your UE4 VR project right from within the UE4 editor by changing the **Play in Editor** option from play in **Selected Viewport (PIE)**
option to the **VR Preview** option.

### Running from outside the UE4 Editor
You can also run a non cooked Standalone game by first creating a shortcut to the **UE4Editor.exe** and then supplying the following command line arguments. 
	
	UE4Editor.exe [MyProject] [MyMap] -game

[REGION:tip]
Note that [MyProject] needs to be the absolute or relative path to your **.uproject** file.
