Unreal Engine 4 has a [set of CPU and GPU profiling tools](Engine/Performance) that will help drill explicitly into what is costing time in your project. 
For CPU profiling, you can drill into specific events and timings using the [CPU profiling tool](Engine/Performance/Profiler), which connects to a remote process. 
For GPU profiling, there are more options.  First of all, and most specifically, there's Unreal Engine 4's [GPU profiler](Engine/Performance/GPU), which can be brought up with 
**Ctrl + Shift + Comma** in editor builds running with `-game` emulation.  

Additionally, you could go further drilling into more systemic problems using both GPUView and Nsight. 


## Oculus PerfHud

[Include:Platforms\VR\Profiling\Tools\#OculusPerfHud]
<!--
[EXCERPT:OculusPerfHud]
Oculus PerfHud is a tool that can be displayed in game, whether in editor or in packaged builds, that will help verify the actual CPU and GPU timings, excluding any throttling done by the application.  There's a great overview of the screens 
and what the values mean in Oculus' [documentation](https://developer3.oculus.com/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/dg-hud/).

In general, you'll want to look at the graphs and values on the **Application Render Timing** screen.  These will give you the CPU and GPU timings as the Oculus compositor sees them, and will be more accurate for Draw and GPU timings.

To enable the PerfHud in UE4, type the following in the console:

	hmd setint PerfHudMode N
	
where N is:

| N | Display type |
| --- | -----------|
|	0	| Turns off the performance HUD |
|	1	| Shows performance summary and headroom |
|	2	| Shows latency related timing info |
|	3	| Shows render timing info for application |
|	4	| Shows render timing info for OVR compositor |
|	5	| Shows SDK & HMD version Info |

## SteamVR Frame Timing Tool

The SteamVR Frame Timing will allow you see how your VR project is performing in both the UE4 Editor or in a packaged build. This tool will help verify the actual CPU and GPU timings, excluding any throttling done by the application. There's a great overview of how to open the tool as well as what all of the values relate to on the 
[Valve Developer Community]( https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamVR/Frame_Timing) page. Please note that there is nothing inside of UE4 that needs to be done in order for the SteamVR Frame Timing tools to work. All of the tool functionality and use is done from the SteamVR Application.

## RenderDoc

RenderDoc is an external tool you can also use for profiling Unreal Engine projects. 
To use it with UE4:

1. Download the latest [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/builds).
1. In RenderDoc, configure it to launch your game (e.g. UE4Editor.exe, with appropriate command line arguments).
1. Run `ToggleDrawEvents` from the command line of your app to get human readable events.
1. Press F12 to capture a frame.
