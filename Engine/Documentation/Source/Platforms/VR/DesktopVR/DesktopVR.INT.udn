Contained with the pages linked below you will find a multitude of different documents that can help you get any of the supported VR HMD's working with your UE4 project.

* **Oculus Rift**
* **HTC Vive** 


The fact that UE4 natively supports the above desktop HMD's means that you do not need to do any additional downloading or compiling to view your UE4 project in VR.
