The Oculus Guardian system is used to display the boundaries of the VR interaction area. As a tracked device approaches the boundaries, the Oculus Runtime automatically provides visual cues notifying the user of this. In the following How - To we will take a look at changing the color, the Oculus Guardian system uses to display the VR interaction area.

[REGION:note]
The following How - To is going to make use of the Standing VR Pawn with added Touch Controller and Guardian support. If you are not sure how to set this up, the following two How - To's will help you out.

[REGION:note]
For the Guardian system to work, you will need to make sure you have set it up using the Oculus App. For more information on how to do this, please see the official [Oculus Guardian System](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/dg-guardian-system/) Setup pages.

[REGION:warning]
It is **NOT** possible nor advisable to disable the Guardian system from inside UE4. You can, however, adjust how UE4 will react to the user getting close to the boundaries.

1. Create a new **Variable** called **Oculus Rift Boundary Color** and set its type to **Linear Color** and its color to **Red**.
