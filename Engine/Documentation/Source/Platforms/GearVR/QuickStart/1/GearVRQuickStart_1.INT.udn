In the following part of the Gear VR Quick Start, we will go over setting up a new UE4 project that can be used with Gear VR.

## Steps

1. From the [Unreal Engine Launcher](http://tinyurl.com/oawb7x2) make sure that you have UE4 version **4.17** or later downloaded and installed then press the **Launch** button to open the **Unreal Project Browser**.

    * **Blank Project**
    * **Mobile / Tablet**
    * **Scalable 3D / 2D**
    * **No Starter Content**

1. Next, set the project's location and give it a name. For this example, the name will be **GearVRQS** but feel free to pick any name you want. When that has been completed, press the **Create Project** button to create the project and load the UE4 Editor.
