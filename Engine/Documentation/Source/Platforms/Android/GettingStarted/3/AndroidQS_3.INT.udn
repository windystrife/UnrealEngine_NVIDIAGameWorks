## Steps

In the following section we will be creating a new project for use to test deployment to Android with.
The project that we create will be a Blueprint based project that will use the Blueprint Third Person template.



1. From the **Unreal Projects Browser** create a new Blueprint based project with the following options. 
* Use the Third Person Template
* Set target hardware to Mobile / Tablet
* Set the Graphics level to Scalable 3D or 2D
* Do not include the Starter Content
* Give the project a name of AndroidProject

1. Once that is completed, press the **Create Project** button to create the project.

[REGION:tip]
While we have selected a Blueprint based project for this example, any type of project, C++ or Blueprint, can be used to packaged and deployed to an Android device.
