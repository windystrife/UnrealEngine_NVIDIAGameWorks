Now that we have gone over how to get your UE4 project packaged and ready to be tested on your Android device, 
try and accomplish the following using what you have learned from this Quick Start guide. 

* Create a new project using one of the default templates and then try and get that project running on your Android device.
* Try packaging your project using different Android Texture formats and see which ones will work for your Android device.
* Check the size of your package, and then, using the [Reducing APK Package size](Platforms/Android/ReducingAPKSize) document, try reducing the size of your packaged game.
* Check out the [Gear VR Debugging](Platforms/GearVR/Debugging) document and then try to deploy your project to an Android device over a wireless network.
