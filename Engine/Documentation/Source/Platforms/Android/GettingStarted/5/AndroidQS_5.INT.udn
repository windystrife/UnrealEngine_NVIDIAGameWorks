[region:note]
We are currently packaging in **Development** because we are testing this game, but when your game is complete, you can package it in **Shipping** by hovering over the **Build Configurations** option in the **Package Project** menu.
[/region]

1.	In the **File** menu, go to **Package Project > Android** and select the Texture format you want to package. 
	For this example, we will choose Android **ETC1** as it is supported by all devices.

	[/REGION]

	[REGION:note]
	Different devices support different Texture formats depending on the hardware they run on. See, [](Platforms/Android/Reference) for a detailed breakdown of the various formats.
	[/REGION]

1.	You will then be prompted for a location to save your packaged game. For now create a new folder on the desktop and select that as the location to save your project to.

1. While your project is being packaged a packaging message will appear in the bottom right corner showing the progress of the packing.

1.	Once packaging is successful, a Packaging Complete message will appear in the bottom right of the editor.

	![](Packageing_Completed.png)

1.	Navigate to the folder that was created in step two and in this folder you should have a new folder named specifically for the texture type you selected when packaging. 
	In this example, the folder is named **Android_ETC1**.

	![](Android_ECT1_Folder.png)

1.	Open up the Android_ETC1 folder and then  **Double-click** on the **Install_[ProjectName]_Development.bat** batch file to install the project on your Android device.

	![](Install_Bat.png)
	[region:note]
	You must have your Android device plugged into your development PC via USB to deploy the project to your device. If you do not have your device plugged in running the .BAT file will do nothing.
	[/region]

1.	After the .BAT file has finished you should now see your project ready to be used on your Android device.
