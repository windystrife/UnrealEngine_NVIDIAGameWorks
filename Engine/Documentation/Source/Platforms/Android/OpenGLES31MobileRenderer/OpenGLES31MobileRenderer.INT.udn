While Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) has long supported many OpenGL ES 3.0 and 3.1 features on Android, you can now specifically target ES 3.1 when building a UE4 Android project. This brings feature parity with Metal and Vulkan to higher-end Android devices and gives you access to 16 Texture samplers as well as improved performance through the use of uniform buffers. In the following document we will take a look how you can setup your UE4 project to use OpenGL ES 3.1 when run on an Android device that supports it.


## Enabling the OpenGL ES 3.1 UE4 Editor Preview 

In order to preview what OpenGL ES 3.1 will look like in the UE4 Editor, you will need to first enable it by doing the following:

1. Go to the **Main Tool Bar**, click on the **Settings** option and go to **Preview Rendering Level** option and select the **High-End Mobile / Metal** and finally **High-End Mobile** option.

1. Once the shaders have recompiled, if you look at the lower right-hand corner of the UE4 Editor viewport, you should see the text **Feature Level: ES3_1** which means you are now previewing the level using OpenGL ES 3.1's feature set.

## Setting up a UE4 Project with OpenGL ES 3.1 Support

To use OpenGL ES 3.1 in your UE4 Android project, you will need to make sure your UE4 project has the following options set:

[region:warning]
Please note that OpenGL ES 3.1 Support will only work on code based projects that are downloaded and compiled from Github. If you are not familiar with how to do this, check out the [Download Unreal Engine Source Code](GettingStarted/DownloadingUnrealEngine) for detailed instructions.

## Building and Deploying a UE4 Project with OpenGL ES 3.1 Support

Now that the project has been setup to work with OpenGL ES 3.1, it is time to build the project and deploy it to a Android based Smartphone. To build a project that has OpenGL ES 3.1 support you will need to do the following:

[region:note]
Before beginning the next part, make sure that you have your Android Smartphone plugged into your development PC via a USB cable. Failing to do this will result in your project not being able to be deployed.

1. Locate the **Launch** option that is on the far right-hand side of the **Toolbar** menu.
