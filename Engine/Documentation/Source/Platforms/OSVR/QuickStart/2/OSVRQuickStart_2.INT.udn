1. From the UE4 Launcher, make sure that you have UE4 version **4.12** or later downloaded and installed then press the **Launch** button to open the **Unreal Project Browser**.

1. Due to the demanding rendering requirements of VR in general, it is best to start out any new UE4 VR project with the following settings to ensure that your project will run at the correct frame rate right from the start:
