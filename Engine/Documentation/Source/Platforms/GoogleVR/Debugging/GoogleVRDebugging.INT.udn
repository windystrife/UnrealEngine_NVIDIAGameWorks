In the following document we will take a look at the various ways you can go about tracking down performance issues in your Google VR projects. 

## Google Daydream Performance HUD

[region:note]
The Daydream Performance HUD is a performance overlay enabled for all Daydream applications built with Google VR SDK 1.60 and above.
[/region]

Google Daydream comes with a built in performance overlay that when enabled, will provide quick insight into performance issues  you might encounter. With this overlay enabled you are able to see the following stats:

* **Application frame submit rate and whether frames were blocked on the GPU**
* **Asynchronous Reprojection statistics**
* **Process memory usage**
* **How many degrees (°C) the device is from thermal throttling**

### Enabling Performance HUD

To enable the Performance HUD you will need to do the following.

1. Open VR Settings, available by tapping the gear icon at the top right of the phone's screen after launching a Daydream application.
