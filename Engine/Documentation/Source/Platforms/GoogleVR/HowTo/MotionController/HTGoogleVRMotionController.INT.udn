The Google Daydream Motion Controller allows you to interact with your UE4 project like never before by enabling users to pick up and interact with objects like they would in the real world.  In the following How - To we will take a look at how you can setup your UE4 projects to work with the Google Daydream Motion Controller.

[region:note]
This How - To will utilize the pawn the that was created in the [Set Up Cameras for Google VR How - To](Platforms\GoogleVR\HowTo\CameraSetup). If you have not completed this How - To it is highly suggested you do before continuing.

Motion Controllers will work only with devices that support Google Daydream.

1. First, open up the player pawn you want to add Motion Controller support to, in this example, our pawn is called **GoogleVR_Pawn_MotionController**, and in the **Components** tab, click on the **Add Component** button and then search for **GoogleVRMotionController**.

1. Drag the newly added **GoogleVRMotionController** on top of the existing **VRCameraRoot** so that it is a child component like the **VRCamera**.

    [region:note]
    By default, the Google VR Motion Controller Component **Location** should be set to 0,0,0 when added to your Pawn. If for some reason this is not the case, make sure and set the location to 0,0,0.

1. Compile and save the Blueprint and then drag the **GoogleVR_Pawn_MotionController** Pawn from the Content Browser to the level.

1. Select the newly added Player Pawn and in the **Details** panel, make sure to set the **Auto Possess Player** to **Player 0** so that we will use this Pawn when the level is running.

1. When your project launches, put your phone in your Google VR headset and pick up your Google VR Daydream Motion Controller. Now when you move the Motion Controller around in the real world, you should see that movement replicated in your UE4 project like in the following video.
