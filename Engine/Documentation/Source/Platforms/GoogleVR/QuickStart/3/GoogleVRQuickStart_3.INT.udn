In this section of the Google VR Quick Start, we will go over what you have to do to package your UE4 project so that it will run on a Google VR device.

[region:note]
Before going any further make sure that the Smartphone used for testing has been plugged into your development PC via a USB cable and make also make sure that ADB can see your phone as an authorized device. If you are unsure how to do or are having problems getting ADB to see your device, check out the following page for more information [Android How - To Set Up Your Android Device](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Platforms/Android/GettingStarted/2/).

    For this to work, you will need to make sure that your Android Smartphone is plugged into your development PC via a USB cable. Failing to do this will result in the project not being installed on the device.

    To make sure that your phone and UE4 are properly configured for the VR device you are using click on the **Gear** icon that is displayed while the app is running.

    From the displayed menu, you can scan the QR code that is on the side of your VR device, and that will make sure UE4 outputs an image that is compatible with your VR device.

## End Result

When completed you will be able to view the UE4 project using Google VR.
