## Configuration

1. Set up your in-app purchase in iTunes Connect:

    [REGION:note]
	Google Play requires the id to be all lowercase, and it's best to have the ID for iOS and Android match for ease of Blueprint setup.
	[/REGION]

1. Make a note of the ID you use, as well as if the item is consumable or non-consumable.

1. If you have a Blueprint project, you're set to go. If you have a code project and have not already set up your project to use online subsystems, add the following block to your project's Build.cs file: 

		if (Target.Platform == UnrealTargetPlatform.IOS)
		{
			PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "Core", "CoreUObject", "Engine", "OnlineSubsystem" });
			DynamicallyLoadedModuleNames.Add("OnlineSubsystemIOS");
		}

1. Edit [ProjectName]/Config/IOS/IOSEngine.ini:

		[OnlineSubsystemIOS.Store]
		bSupportsInAppPurchasing=True

## Testing

You can test with a build that you load onto the device yourself, as well as with a build uploaded to iTunes Connect. Any users testing the purchase must be Internal or External Testers in iTunes Connect, and must have accepted that invitation. You'll also need your custom provision.
